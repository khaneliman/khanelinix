# planning-with-files: Stop-hook dispatcher for the v3 completion gate.
#
# Thin wrapper: discover check-complete.sh (sibling first, then the known
# install paths) and run it with --gate, passing the Stop hook's stdin JSON
# through so check-complete can read stop_hook_active and apply the gate
# decision table. check-complete in --gate mode is the host-aware termination
# oracle (W1A); without --gate it keeps the legacy advisory echo behavior.
#
# Always exits with check-complete's exit code. In legacy mode (no .mode file)
# check-complete --gate never blocks, so the Stop event proceeds exactly as v2.
