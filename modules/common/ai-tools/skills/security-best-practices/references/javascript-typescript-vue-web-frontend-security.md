# Vue.js Web Security Spec (Vue 3.x, TypeScript/JavaScript, common tooling: Vite)

This document is designed as a **security spec** that supports:

1. **Secure-by-default code generation** for new Vue code.
2. **Security review / vulnerability hunting** in existing Vue code (passive
   “notice issues while working” and active “scan the repo and report
   findings”).

It is intentionally written as a set of **normative requirements**
(“MUST/SHOULD/MAY”) plus **audit rules** (what bad patterns look like, how to
detect them, and how to fix/mitigate them).

---

## 0) Safety, boundaries, and anti-abuse constraints (MUST FOLLOW)

- MUST NOT request, output, log, or commit secrets (API keys, passwords, private
  keys, session cookies, auth tokens).
- MUST NOT “fix” security by disabling protections (e.g., weakening CSP, turning
  on unsafe template compilation, using `v-html` as a shortcut, bypassing
  backend auth, or “just store the token in localStorage”).
- MUST provide **evidence-based findings** during audits: cite file paths, code
  snippets, and configuration values that justify the claim.
- MUST treat uncertainty honestly: if a protection might exist at the edge (CDN,
  reverse proxy, WAF, server headers), report it as “not visible in repo; verify
  runtime/infra config”.
- MUST remember the frontend trust model: **any code shipped to browsers is
  attacker-readable and attacker-modifiable**. Secrets and “security
  enforcement” cannot rely on frontend-only logic.

---

## 1) Operating modes

### 1.1 Generation mode (default)

When asked to write new Vue code or modify existing code:

- MUST follow every **MUST** requirement in this spec.
- SHOULD follow every **SHOULD** requirement unless the user explicitly says
  otherwise.
- MUST prefer safe-by-default framework features and proven libraries over
  custom security code.
- MUST avoid introducing new risky sinks (runtime template compilation, `v-html`
  / `innerHTML`, unsafe URL navigation, dynamic script injection, etc.).
  ([Vue.js][1])

### 1.2 Passive review mode (always on while editing)

While working anywhere in a Vue repo (even if the user did not ask for a
security scan):

- MUST “notice” violations of this spec in touched/nearby code.
- SHOULD mention issues as they come up, with a brief explanation + safe fix.

### 1.3 Active audit mode (explicit scan request)

When the user asks to “scan”, “audit”, or “hunt for vulns”:

- MUST systematically search the codebase for violations of this spec.
- MUST output findings in a structured format (see §2.3).

Recommended audit order:

1. Build/deploy entrypoints and hosting config (Docker, CI, static hosting, SSR
   server).
2. Secrets exposure (env usage, `.env*`, hard-coded keys). ([vitejs][2])
3. XSS surface: templates, `v-html` / `innerHTML`, URL/style injection, DOM
   APIs. ([Vue.js][1])
4. Auth/session handling in the browser (token storage, credentialed requests,
   CSRF integration). ([Vue.js][1])
5. Routing/navigation (open redirects, “return_to/next”, unsafe external
   navigation). ([Vue.js][1])
6. Third-party scripts and content (CDN assets, analytics, widgets, iframes).
   ([Vue.js][1])
7. Security headers and browser hardening expectations (CSP, clickjacking).
   ([Vue.js][1])
8. SSR-specific concerns (state serialization, template boundaries) when
   applicable. ([Vue.js][1])

---

## 2) Definitions and review guidance

### 2.1 Untrusted input (treat as attacker-controlled unless proven otherwise)

In a Vue app, untrusted input includes (non-exhaustive):

- Anything from APIs: `fetch`, `axios`, GraphQL responses, webhooks, third-party
  SDKs.
- Router-controlled data: `route.params`, `route.query`, `route.hash`, and
  anything derived from `window.location`.
- User-controlled persisted content: DB-backed content displayed in the UI
  (comments, profiles, CMS content).
- Browser-controlled storage: `localStorage`, `sessionStorage`, `IndexedDB`.
- Cross-window messages: `postMessage` inputs.
- Anything that can be influenced by an attacker through DOM clobbering or
  injected HTML (especially if Vue is mounted onto non-sterile DOM).
  ([Vue.js][1])

### 2.2 State-changing action (frontend perspective)

An action is state-changing if it can:

- Create/update/delete data via API calls.
- Change authentication/session state (login, logout, refresh token).
- Trigger privileged operations (payments, admin actions).
- Cause side effects (sending emails, triggering webhooks, changing account
  settings).

### 2.3 Required audit finding format

For each issue found, output:

- Rule ID:
- Severity: Critical / High / Medium / Low
- Location: file path + component/function + line(s)
- Evidence: the exact code/config snippet
- Impact: what could go wrong, who can exploit it
- Fix: safe change (prefer minimal diff)
- Mitigation: defense-in-depth if immediate fix is hard
- False positive notes: what to verify if uncertain

---

## 3) Secure baseline: minimum production configuration (MUST in production)

This is the smallest “production baseline” that prevents common Vue/front-end
misconfigurations.

- MUST ship a **production build** (not a development build or dev server).
  ([Vue.js][3])
- MUST NOT ship secrets in frontend bundles; treat all client-exposed env
  variables as public. ([vitejs][2])
- MUST NOT render non-trusted templates or allow user-provided Vue templates
  (equivalent to arbitrary JS execution). ([Vue.js][1])
- SHOULD avoid raw HTML injection (`v-html`, `innerHTML`) unless content is
  trusted or strongly sandboxed. ([Vue.js][1])
- SHOULD deploy baseline security headers (especially CSP and clickjacking
  defenses) at the server/CDN layer. ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][4])
- SHOULD use safe auth patterns (prefer HttpOnly cookies for session tokens;
  coordinate with backend on CSRF). ([Vue.js][1])

---

## 4) Rules (generation + audit)

Each rule contains: required practice, insecure patterns, detection hints, and
remediation.

### VUE-DEPLOY-001: Do not run dev/preview servers in production

Severity: High

Required:

- MUST NOT deploy the Vite/Vue dev server (`vite`, `npm run dev`, HMR) as the
  production server.
- MUST NOT use `vite preview` as a production server. ([vitejs][5])
- MUST build (`vite build`) and serve the built assets using a production-grade
  static server/CDN, or a production SSR server if you are doing SSR.
  ([vitejs][6])

Insecure patterns:

- Docker/Procfile/systemd running `vite`, `npm run dev`, or `vite preview` as
  the production entrypoint.
- Publicly exposed HMR endpoints.

Detection hints:

- Search: `vite`, `npm run dev`, `pnpm dev`, `yarn dev`, `vite preview`,
  `vue-cli-service serve`.
- Check Docker `CMD`, `ENTRYPOINT`, CI deploy scripts, platform config.

Fix:

- Build artifacts with `vite build`.
- Serve `dist/` with hardened hosting (CDN/static server) or integrate into your
  backend server as static assets.

Notes:

- Using dev/preview servers locally is fine; only flag if it is the production
  entrypoint.

---

### VUE-DEPLOY-002: Use Vue production builds and keep devtools off in production

Severity: Medium (High if production devtools/debug hooks are enabled)

Required:

- If loading Vue from CDN/self-host without a bundler, MUST use the `.prod.js`
  builds in production. ([Vue.js][3])
- SHOULD ensure production bundles do not enable Vue devtools in production
  builds, and SHOULD not intentionally enable production devtools flags.
  ([Vue.js][7])

Insecure patterns:

- Production includes development build artifacts.
- Explicitly enabling production devtools/diagnostic hooks.

Detection hints:

- Search HTML for `vue.global.js` / non-`.prod.js` variants when using CDN
  builds.
- Search build config for Vue feature flags like `__VUE_PROD_DEVTOOLS__`.
  ([Vue.js][7])

Fix:

- Switch to production build artifacts and ensure compile-time flags are
  configured for production.

---

### VUE-SECRETS-001: Never ship secrets in frontend code or env variables

Severity: High (Critical if real credentials are exposed)

Required:

- MUST treat all frontend code and configuration as public.
- MUST NOT embed secrets in:

  - source code
  - `.env` files committed to repo
  - `import.meta.env.*` variables included in the bundle
- MUST assume any env var that ends up in the client bundle is
  attacker-readable. ([vitejs][2])

Insecure patterns:

- `VITE_API_KEY=...` containing a true secret (not just a public identifier).
- Hard-coded API keys, private tokens, service credentials, signing keys in
  JS/TS.

Detection hints:

- Search: `VITE_`, `import.meta.env`, `.env`, `.env.production`, `.env.*.local`.
- Grep for `API_KEY`, `SECRET`, `TOKEN`, `PRIVATE_KEY`, `BEGIN`, `sk-`, `AKIA`,
  etc.

Fix:

- Move secrets to backend/edge functions.
- Use backend-minted short-lived tokens for the browser when needed.

Notes:

- Vite specifically warns that `.env.*.local` should be gitignored and that
  `VITE_*` vars end up in the client bundle, so they must not contain sensitive
  info. ([vitejs][2])

---

### VUE-SECRETS-002: Do not broaden Vite env exposure

Severity: High

Required:

- MUST NOT configure Vite to expose all environment variables to the client.
- SHOULD keep `envPrefix` strict and explicit.

Insecure patterns:

- Setting `envPrefix` to overly broad values (or `''`) to “make env vars work”.
- Custom scripts that inject server secrets into global variables in HTML at
  build time.

Detection hints:

- Check `vite.config.*` for `envPrefix`.
- Look for `define: { 'process.env': ... }` or manual injection into
  `window.__CONFIG__`.

Fix:

- Keep secrets server-side.
- Only expose non-sensitive values intentionally designed to be public.

Notes:

- Vite’s docs explain that only prefixed variables are exposed and that exposed
  variables land in the client bundle. ([vitejs][2])

---

### VUE-XSS-001: Prefer Vue’s default escaping; avoid raw HTML injection

Severity: High

Required:

- MUST rely on Vue’s automatic escaping for text interpolation and attribute
  binding where possible. ([Vue.js][1])
- MUST NOT render user-provided HTML via:

  - `v-html`
  - `innerHTML` in render functions / JSX
  - direct DOM APIs (`element.innerHTML`, `insertAdjacentHTML`) unless the HTML
    is trusted or robustly sanitized and the risk is explicitly accepted.
    ([Vue.js][1])

Insecure patterns:

- `<div v-html="userProvidedHtml"></div>`
- `h('div', { innerHTML: userProvidedHtml })`
- `<div innerHTML={userProvidedHtml}></div>`
- `el.innerHTML = untrusted`

Detection hints:

- Search: `v-html`, `innerHTML`, `insertAdjacentHTML`, `DOMParser`,
  `document.write`.

Fix:

- Render untrusted content as text (interpolation).
- If HTML rendering is required (e.g., Markdown), sanitize with a
  well-maintained HTML sanitizer and apply defense-in-depth (CSP, Trusted
  Types). ([Vue.js][1])

Notes:

- Vue’s docs explicitly warn that user-provided HTML is never “100% safe” unless
  sandboxed or strictly self-only exposure. ([Vue.js][1])

---

### VUE-XSS-002: Never use non-trusted templates (client-side template/code injection)

Severity: Critical

Required:

- MUST NOT use non-trusted content as a Vue component template.
- MUST treat “user can write a Vue template” as “user can execute arbitrary
  JavaScript in your app”, and potentially in SSR contexts too. ([Vue.js][1])
- SHOULD prefer the runtime-only build (templates compiled at build time) and
  avoid shipping the runtime compiler unless you have a vetted need.

Insecure patterns:

- `createApp({ template: '<div>' + userProvidedString + '</div>' }).mount(...)`
- Storing templates in DB and compiling/rendering them in the browser.
- Admin/CMS features that allow entering Vue template syntax.

Detection hints:

- Search: `template:` where the value is not a static string.
- Search: `@vue/compiler-dom`, `compile(`, “runtime compiler” build selection,
  dynamic SFC compilation.
- Search for “template editor”, “custom template”, “theme HTML” features.

Fix:

- Treat templates as code: keep them developer-controlled.
- If end-user customization is required, use a safe format (restricted Markdown
  subset) rendered via a sanitizer, or isolate in a sandboxed iframe.

---

### VUE-XSS-003: Do not mount Vue onto DOM that may contain user-provided server-rendered HTML

Severity: Medium

Required:

- MUST NOT mount Vue on nodes that may contain server-rendered and user-provided
  content (because attacker-controlled HTML that is “safe as HTML” may become
  unsafe as a Vue template). ([Vue.js][1])
- SHOULD mount Vue into a “sterile” root element and render the app’s DOM from
  Vue-controlled templates/components.

Insecure patterns:

- Server renders user content into `#app`, then Vue mounts on `#app` and
  compiles/interprets that DOM as a template.
- “Sprinkling Vue” on large server-rendered pages that include user-generated
  content.

Detection hints:

- Check server templates (e.g., Rails/Django/Express templates) for user HTML
  inserted inside the Vue mount root.
- Look for `mount('#app')` where `#app` includes server-rendered UGC.

Fix:

- Move user-rendered HTML outside the Vue mount root, or render it in a safe way
  (text/sanitized HTML) from Vue components.

---

### VUE-XSS-004: Prevent URL injection in bindings and navigations

Severity: High

Required:

- MUST validate/sanitize any user-influenced URL before binding to navigation
  sinks (`href`, `src`, `action`, `window.location`, `window.open`, router
  navigation to external).
- MUST specifically prevent `javascript:` URL execution in bindings like
  `<a :href="userProvidedUrl">`. ([Vue.js][1])
- SHOULD validate protocol and destination (allowlist `https:` and expected
  hosts; allow `mailto:`/`tel:` only if intended).

Insecure patterns:

- `<iframe :src="userProvidedUrl">`
- `window.location = route.query.next`
- `window.open(userProvidedUrl)`

Detection hints:

- Search: `:href=`, `:src=`, `window.location`, `location.href`, `window.open`,
  `router.push(` with untrusted input.
- Look for `next`, `return_to`, `redirect` query params.

Fix:

- Prefer internal navigation via route names/paths you control.
- For external URLs: parse with `new URL(...)`, allowlist protocol/host, reject
  `javascript:` and other dangerous schemes.
- Sanitize and validate on the backend before storing user URLs (Vue docs
  explicitly recommend backend sanitization). ([Vue.js][1])

---

### VUE-XSS-005: Prevent style/CSS injection and UI redress

Severity: Low

Required:

- MUST NOT bind attacker-controlled CSS strings broadly (e.g.,
  `:style="userProvidedStyles"`).
- SHOULD use Vue’s style object syntax and only allow safe, specific properties
  if user customization is needed. ([Vue.js][1])
- SHOULD isolate “user can control layout/CSS” features inside sandboxed
  iframes.

Insecure patterns:

- `:style="userProvidedStyles"` where styles are attacker-controlled.
- Rendering user-provided `<style>` content (even if Vue blocks some patterns,
  don’t try to work around it).

Detection hints:

- Search: `:style="` bound to non-constant variables that originate from
  API/user content.
- Search for “custom CSS”, “theme editor”, “profile CSS”.

Fix:

- Allowlist properties and values; avoid raw style strings.
- Use sandboxed iframes for rich user customization.

---

### VUE-XSS-006: Never bind user-provided JavaScript into event handler attributes

Severity: Critical

Required:

- MUST NOT bind attacker-provided strings into event handler attributes (e.g.,
  `onclick`, `onfocus`, etc.).
- MUST treat “user-provided JS” as unsafe unless sandboxed and self-only
  exposure is guaranteed. ([Vue.js][1])

Insecure patterns:

- `<div :onclick="userProvidedString">`
- `<a :onmouseenter="userProvidedString">`

Detection hints:

- Search: `:on` followed by event attribute names (`:onclick`, `:onload`, etc.).
- Search for `setAttribute('on` patterns.

Fix:

- Use real event listeners with developer-controlled handlers.
- If you truly need user scripting, isolate it (sandboxed iframe + strict
  boundaries).

---

### VUE-ROUTER-001: Do not treat client-side route guards as authorization

Severity: High

Required:

- MUST NOT rely on Vue Router guards, UI hiding, or client-side checks to
  enforce authorization.
- MUST enforce authorization on the backend for every privileged action and
  sensitive data response. ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][8])

Insecure patterns:

- “Admin route is protected because `beforeEach` checks `user.isAdmin`.”
- Sensitive API endpoints that assume “the frontend won’t call this unless
  allowed.”

Detection hints:

- Search `router.beforeEach` for role-based gating and see if the backend is
  also enforcing.
- Look for “security by route meta” patterns (`meta.requiresAdmin`) with no
  server corroboration.

Fix:

- Keep route guards as UX only (reduce accidental access), but enforce real
  checks server-side.

---

### VUE-ROUTER-002: Prevent open redirects and unsafe “return_to/next” handling

Severity: Low

Required:

- MUST validate redirect destinations derived from untrusted input (`next`,
  `return_to`, `redirect`).
- SHOULD allow only same-site relative paths or an explicit allowlist of
  destinations.
- MUST NOT allow non `http` / `https` protos (such as `javascript:`)

Insecure patterns:

- `router.push(route.query.next as string)`
- `window.location.href = route.query.redirect`

Detection hints:

- Search for `route.query.next`, `route.query.redirect`, `return_to`,
  `continue`, `callback`.
- Trace the value into router/window navigation sinks.

Fix:

- Allow only relative paths starting with `/` (and reject `//host`,
  `javascript:`, etc.).
- Prefer redirecting to named routes you control.

Notes:

- Even Vue’s docs note that sanitized URLs still may not guarantee safe
  destinations. ([Vue.js][1])

---

### VUE-AUTH-001: Token storage must assume XSS is possible

Severity: Low

Required:

- MUST assume any token accessible to JavaScript can be stolen via XSS.
- SHOULD prefer HttpOnly cookies (set by the backend) for session tokens,
  combined with CSRF protections where relevant. ([Vue.js][1])
- SHOULD avoid storing long-lived tokens (especially refresh tokens) in
  `localStorage`/`sessionStorage`.

Insecure patterns:

- `localStorage.setItem('token', ...)` for long-lived bearer tokens.
- Storing refresh tokens in JS-accessible storage.

Detection hints:

- Search: `localStorage`, `sessionStorage`, `indexedDB`, `persist`,
  `pinia-plugin-persistedstate`.
- Identify whether stored values are auth/session material.

Fix:

- Prefer backend-managed sessions via HttpOnly cookies.
- If bearer tokens are unavoidable, keep them short-lived, stored in memory, and
  rotate frequently; combine with strong XSS mitigations (CSP, Trusted Types,
  strict sanitization). ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][4])

---

### VUE-CSRF-001: Coordinate with the backend for CSRF when using cookies

Severity: High (for cookie-authenticated state-changing requests)

NOTE: If the application is not using cookie based authentication (for example
if it passes an Authorization header), then CSRF is not a concern

Required:

- If API requests include cookies (`credentials: 'include'` /
  `withCredentials: true`) and cookies authenticate the user, MUST include CSRF
  protections coordinated with the backend (token/header patterns, Origin
  checks, SameSite cookies as defense-in-depth). ([Vue.js][1])
- MUST NOT “solve CORS/CSRF errors” by disabling protections on the backend or
  using `mode: 'no-cors'` on the frontend.

Insecure patterns:

- `fetch(url, { credentials: 'include', method: 'POST', body: ... })` with no
  CSRF token/header usage anywhere.
- Enabling cross-origin credentialed requests without strict origin allowlists
  (backend-side).

Detection hints:

- Search: `credentials: 'include'`, `withCredentials`, `xsrf`, `csrf`,
  `X-CSRF-Token`, `X-XSRF-TOKEN`.
- Look at API wrapper modules for headers and cookie settings.

Fix:

- Implement backend-issued CSRF tokens and require them on state-changing
  requests.
- Keep cookies `SameSite=Lax/Strict` where compatible and verify Origin/Referer
  where appropriate (backend-driven). ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][9])

Notes:

- Vue’s docs explicitly say CSRF is primarily backend-addressed but recommends
  coordinating on CSRF token submission. ([Vue.js][1])

---

### VUE-HTTP-001: Do not put secrets in URLs; avoid leaking sensitive data in navigation/logs

Severity: Medium

Required:

- MUST NOT place tokens/secrets in query strings or fragments (they leak via
  logs, referrers, browser history).
- SHOULD avoid logging sensitive values to console in production.

Insecure patterns:

- `/?token=...`, `/#access_token=...` used beyond short-lived OAuth handoff.
- `console.log(userSession)` that includes tokens/PII.

Detection hints:

- Search for `token=` in router parsing, auth callback handlers, and analytics
  logs.
- Search for `console.log(` around auth code.

Fix:

- Use Authorization headers or HttpOnly cookies.
- Scrub logs; gate debug logs behind dev-only checks.

---

### VUE-HEADERS-001: Require security headers at the deployment layer

Severity: Medium

Required:

- SHOULD deploy a CSP (`Content-Security-Policy`) suitable for your Vue app.
- SHOULD deploy clickjacking defenses (CSP `frame-ancestors` and/or
  `X-Frame-Options`) unless intentional embedding is required.
- SHOULD deploy `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, plus other headers as
  appropriate (Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy).
  ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][4])

Insecure patterns:

- No evidence of headers in server/CDN config for an app with UGC or rich HTML
  rendering.
- CSP includes `unsafe-inline`/`unsafe-eval` without strong justification.

Detection hints:

- Look for hosting config: nginx, Netlify/Vercel headers config,
  CloudFront/Cloudflare rules.
- If absent in repo, flag as “verify at edge”.

Fix:

- Set headers at the edge or in the server. Start with a conservative CSP and
  tighten.

---

### VUE-CSP-001: Use Trusted Types and DOM XSS hardening when feasible

Severity: Low

Required:

- For apps with significant DOM injection surface (rich text, plugins,
  `v-html`), SHOULD consider enabling Trusted Types to reduce DOM XSS risk.
  ([web.dev][10])
- SHOULD treat Trusted Types as defense-in-depth, not a replacement for
  sanitization.

Insecure patterns:

- Frequent use of `innerHTML`/`v-html` without sanitization or CSP hardening.

Detection hints:

- Search: `v-html`, `innerHTML`, `insertAdjacentHTML`.
- Check CSP for `require-trusted-types-for 'script'` usage (if headers are in
  repo).

Fix:

- Reduce/centralize HTML injection, sanitize inputs, and add Trusted Types
  policies where appropriate.

---

### VUE-THIRDPARTY-001: Avoid dynamic third-party script injection; prefer static, vetted loading

Severity: Low

Required:

- MUST NOT inject `<script src="...">` where the URL is user-controlled.
- SHOULD treat third-party widgets/analytics as supply-chain risk; load only
  from vetted, pinned sources.

Insecure patterns:

- `const s=document.createElement('script'); s.src = userProvidedUrl; ...`
- “Plugin marketplace” that loads arbitrary remote scripts.

Detection hints:

- Search: `createElement('script')`, `.src =`, `appendChild(script)`.
- Search for “loadExternalScript”, “injectScript”, “cdnUrl”.

Fix:

- Bundle dependencies, or allowlist strict origins and enforce integrity (see
  SRI rule).
- Consider sandboxed iframes for untrusted third-party UI.

---

### VUE-SRI-001: Use Subresource Integrity for CDN-hosted scripts/styles

Severity: Low

Required:

- If loading scripts/styles from a CDN, SHOULD use Subresource Integrity
  (`integrity` attribute) with appropriate `crossorigin` configuration.
  ([MDN Web Docs][11])
- SHOULD prefer self-hosting or bundling over runtime CDN dependencies for
  security-critical code.

Insecure patterns:

- `<script src="https://cdn.example/...">` with no `integrity`.
- Remote script URLs that can change content without version pinning.

Detection hints:

- Search `index.html` and server templates for `https://` script/style tags.
- Check for `integrity=`.

Fix:

- Add SRI hashes (and pin versions), or bundle assets with your build.

---

### VUE-SUPPLY-001: Dependency and patch hygiene is mandatory

Severity: Low

Required:

- SHOULD keep Vue and official companion libraries updated; Vue explicitly
  recommends using latest versions to remain as secure as possible.
  ([Vue.js][1])
- MUST respond to security advisories promptly.
- SHOULD pin dependencies and keep lockfiles committed (to reduce drift in
  production artifacts).

Insecure patterns:

- Outdated major versions with known CVEs.
- No lockfile in repo; wide semver ranges for critical deps.
- Ignoring advisories for template/rendering/compiler packages.

Detection hints:

- Inspect `package.json`, lockfiles, CI install commands.
- Search for `npm audit` disabled, “ignore vulnerabilities” scripts.

Fix:

- Upgrade dependencies and add regression tests around the impacted behavior.
- Add dependency scanning in CI.

---

### VUE-SSR-001: SSR adds additional trust boundaries; treat state injection as XSS-sensitive

Severity: Medium

Required:

- When using SSR, MUST treat anything injected into the HTML document (initial
  state, serialized data, inline scripts) as XSS-sensitive.
- MUST keep the “trusted templates only” rule even stricter, because unsafe
  templates can lead to server-side execution during rendering. ([Vue.js][1])
- SHOULD follow Vue SSR documentation and best practices for SSR security.
  ([Vue.js][1])

Insecure patterns:

- Concatenating untrusted strings into SSR templates.
- Injecting JSON into `<script>` blocks without robust escaping/serialization
  controls.

Detection hints:

- Search server code for `__INITIAL_STATE__`, `window.__*STATE__`, template
  concatenation, and SSR render pipelines.
- Trace untrusted data into those sinks.

Fix:

- Use safe serialization patterns recommended by your SSR stack.
- Avoid rendering untrusted HTML; sanitize or isolate.

---

## 5) Practical scanning heuristics (how to “hunt”)

When actively scanning, use these high-signal patterns:

- Dev/preview servers in production:

  - `npm run dev`, `vite`, `vite preview`, `vue-cli-service serve` ([vitejs][5])
- Secrets exposure:

  - `.env`, `.env.production`, `.env.*.local`, `VITE_`, `import.meta.env`,
    hard-coded `API_KEY` / `SECRET` ([vitejs][2])
- XSS sinks:

  - `v-html`, `innerHTML`, `insertAdjacentHTML`, `DOMParser`, `document.write`
    ([Vue.js][1])
- Client-side template injection:

  - `template:` concatenation, `compile(`, runtime compiler usage, mounting on
    non-sterile DOM ([Vue.js][1])
- URL injection / open redirects:

  - `:href="..."` / `:src="..."` from user data
  - `javascript:` occurrences
  - `route.query.next` / `redirect` / `return_to` flowing into `router.push` or
    `window.location` ([Vue.js][1])
- Style injection:

  - `:style="userProvidedStyles"` or user-driven theme CSS ([Vue.js][1])
- Token storage:

  - `localStorage.setItem('token'...)`, persisted auth stores, refresh tokens in
    JS-accessible storage
- CSRF integration red flags:

  - `credentials: 'include'` / `withCredentials: true` without any CSRF
    header/token handling ([Vue.js][1])
- Third-party scripts:

  - dynamic script injection (`createElement('script')`), CDN scripts without
    SRI ([MDN Web Docs][11])
- External links security:

  - `target="_blank"` without `rel="noopener"`/`noreferrer` (still recommended
    for legacy and explicitness) ([MDN Web Docs][12])

Always try to confirm:

- data origin (untrusted vs trusted)
- sink type (HTML/DOM insertion, template compilation, URL navigation, style
  injection, script injection)
- protective controls present (sanitization, allowlists, CSP/Trusted Types,
  backend validation)
