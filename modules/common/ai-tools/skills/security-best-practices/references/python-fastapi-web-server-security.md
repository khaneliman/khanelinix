# FastAPI (Python) Web Security Spec (FastAPI 0.128.x, Python 3.x) ([PyPI][1])

This document is designed as a **security spec** that supports:

1. **Secure-by-default code generation** for new FastAPI code.
2. **Security review / vulnerability hunting** in existing FastAPI code (passive
   “notice issues while working” and active “scan the repo and report
   findings”).

It is intentionally written as a set of **normative requirements**
(“MUST/SHOULD/MAY”) plus **audit rules** (what bad patterns look like, how to
detect them, and how to fix/mitigate them).

FastAPI is commonly deployed with an ASGI server (e.g., Uvicorn) and is built on
Starlette + Pydantic, so this spec covers those layers where they affect
security. ([PyPI][1])

---

## 0) Safety, boundaries, and anti-abuse constraints (MUST FOLLOW)

- MUST NOT request, output, log, or commit secrets (API keys, passwords, private
  keys, session cookies, signing keys, database URLs with credentials).
- MUST NOT “fix” security by disabling protections (e.g., weakening auth, making
  CORS permissive, skipping signature checks, disabling validation, turning off
  TLS verification, adding `allow_origins=["*"]` with credentials).
- MUST provide **evidence-based findings** during audits: cite file paths, code
  snippets, and configuration values that justify the claim.
- MUST treat uncertainty honestly: if a protection might exist in infrastructure
  (reverse proxy, WAF, CDN, service mesh), report it as “not visible in app
  code; verify at runtime/config”.
- MUST treat browser controls correctly:

  - CORS is **not** an auth mechanism; it only affects browsers.
  - CSRF defenses apply when the browser automatically attaches credentials
    (cookies); they are usually not relevant for purely header-token APIs.
    ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][2])

---

## 1) Operating modes

### 1.1 Generation mode (default)

When asked to write new FastAPI code or modify existing code:

- MUST follow every **MUST** requirement in this spec.
- SHOULD follow every **SHOULD** requirement unless the user explicitly says
  otherwise.
- MUST prefer safe-by-default APIs and proven libraries over custom security
  code.
- MUST avoid introducing new risky sinks (shell execution, unsafe
  deserialization, dynamic eval, untrusted template rendering, unsafe file
  serving, unsafe redirects, arbitrary outbound fetching).

### 1.2 Passive review mode (always on while editing)

While working anywhere in a FastAPI repo (even if the user did not ask for a
security scan):

- MUST “notice” violations of this spec in touched/nearby code.
- SHOULD mention issues as they come up, with a brief explanation + safe fix.

### 1.3 Active audit mode (explicit scan request)

When the user asks to “scan”, “audit”, or “hunt for vulns”:

- MUST systematically search the codebase for violations of this spec.
- MUST output findings in a structured format (see §2.3).

Recommended audit order:

1. App entrypoints / deployment scripts / Dockerfiles / Procfiles /
   Helm/terraform.
2. ASGI server configuration (Uvicorn/Gunicorn), proxy settings, debug/reload
   settings.
3. FastAPI app configuration (docs exposure, middleware, trusted hosts, CORS).
4. Authn/Authz design (dependencies, JWT/session handling, password storage).
5. Cookie/session usage + CSRF (if cookies are used).
6. Input validation and output shaping (Pydantic models, mass assignment,
   excessive data exposure).
7. Template rendering and XSS/SSTI (if HTML is served).
8. File handling (uploads + downloads), StaticFiles, Range support.
9. Injection classes (SQL, command execution, unsafe deserialization).
10. Outbound requests (SSRF), redirect handling, WebSockets security.

---

## 2) Definitions and review guidance

### 2.1 Untrusted input (treat as attacker-controlled unless proven otherwise)

Examples include:

- Query parameters / path parameters
- JSON bodies (including nested fields)
- Headers (including `Host`, `Origin`, `X-Forwarded-*`)
- Cookies (including session cookies)
- File uploads (multipart parts)
- WebSocket messages, query params, and headers during handshake
  ([Starlette][3])
- Any data from external systems (webhooks, third-party APIs, message queues)
- Any persisted user content (DB rows) that originated from users

### 2.2 State-changing request

A request is state-changing if it can create/update/delete data, change
auth/session state, trigger side effects (purchase, email send, webhook send),
or initiate privileged actions.

### 2.3 Required audit finding format

For each issue found, output:

- Rule ID:
- Severity: Critical / High / Medium / Low
- Location: file path + function/route name + line(s)
- Evidence: the exact code/config snippet
- Impact: what could go wrong, who can exploit it
- Fix: safe change (prefer minimal diff)
- Mitigation: defense-in-depth if immediate fix is hard
- False positive notes: what to verify if uncertain

---

## 3) Secure baseline: minimum production configuration (MUST in production)

This is the smallest “production baseline” that prevents common FastAPI/ASGI
misconfigurations.

Baseline goals:

- No debug tracebacks or auto-reload in production. ([PyPI][4])
- Run under a production ASGI server configuration (workers, timeouts, resource
  controls). ([PyPI][4])
- Host header validation enabled (TrustedHostMiddleware or equivalent).
  ([PyPI][5])
- CORS disabled unless explicitly needed; if enabled, it is strict and
  least-privilege. ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][6])
- Auth is enforced consistently via dependencies (no “oops, forgot auth on this
  route”). ([FastAPI][7])
- If cookies/sessions are used, cookie flags are secure and CSRF is addressed.
  ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][8])
- Request size limits and multipart limits exist at the edge and are validated
  in app as needed (to mitigate memory/CPU DoS). ([advisories.gitlab.com][9])
- Dependencies are patched promptly, especially Starlette/python-multipart
  (multiple DoS and traversal advisories exist historically).
  ([advisories.gitlab.com][10])

---

## 4) Rules (generation + audit)

Each rule contains: required practice, insecure patterns, detection hints, and
remediation.

### FASTAPI-DEPLOY-001: Do not use auto-reload / dev-only server modes in production

Severity: High (if production)

Required:

- MUST NOT run production using auto-reload/watch mode (e.g., Uvicorn reload).
- MUST run with a production process model (e.g., multiple workers where
  appropriate) and stable server settings. ([PyPI][4])

Insecure patterns:

- `uvicorn ... --reload` (or equivalent “reload=True” configs) in production
  entrypoints.
- Docker/Procfile/systemd commands that run with `--reload` in production.

Detection hints:

- Search for `--reload`, `reload=True`, `watchfiles`, `fastapi dev`,
  “development” run scripts.
- Check Docker CMD/ENTRYPOINT, Procfile, systemd units, shell scripts.

Fix:

- Remove reload in production; run Uvicorn/Gunicorn with stable settings and
  explicit worker configuration. ([PyPI][4])

Note:

- Reload is fine for local development. Only flag when it is clearly used as a
  production entrypoint.

---

### FASTAPI-DEPLOY-002: Debug mode MUST be disabled in production

Severity: Critical

Required:

- MUST NOT enable debug tracebacks in production (FastAPI/Starlette debug mode
  can expose sensitive internals and make some exploit chains easier).
  ([PyPI][5])
- MUST treat any configuration that returns detailed stack traces to clients as
  sensitive.

Insecure patterns:

- `app = FastAPI(debug=True)` (or Starlette `debug=True`), or equivalent
  environment toggles enabling debug in production. ([PyPI][5])
- Server/log config that exposes tracebacks to end users.

Detection hints:

- Search for `debug=True`, `DEBUG = True`, environment flags mapped to debug.
- Review exception middleware and error handler setup.

Fix:

- Ensure debug is only enabled in local dev/test.
- Return generic error responses to clients; log details internally.

---

### FASTAPI-OPENAPI-001: OpenAPI and interactive docs MUST be disabled or protected in production

Severity: Medium (can be High in sensitive/internal apps)

Required:

- SHOULD disable `/docs`, `/redoc`, and `/openapi.json` in production for
  public-facing services unless there is an explicit business need.
- If enabled, MUST protect them (e.g., auth, network allowlists, or
  internal-only routing).
- MUST NOT assume “security through obscurity”; treat docs exposure as an
  information disclosure amplifier.

Insecure patterns:

- Publicly reachable `/docs` and `/openapi.json` for internal/admin APIs.
- Docs enabled on the same hostname as production without access control.

Detection hints:

- Look for `FastAPI(docs_url=..., redoc_url=..., openapi_url=...)` or defaults.
- Check reverse proxy routing and allowlists.

Fix:

- Disable docs endpoints in prod (`docs_url=None`, `redoc_url=None`,
  `openapi_url=None`) or restrict access at the edge.

---

### FASTAPI-AUTH-001: Authentication MUST be explicit and consistently enforced via dependencies

Severity: High

Required:

- MUST implement authentication as a dependency (or router-level dependency) so
  that protected endpoints cannot “forget” auth.
- MUST default to “deny” for privileged routers/endpoints; explicitly mark truly
  public routes.
- SHOULD centralize auth enforcement at router boundaries (e.g., protected
  `APIRouter` for authenticated endpoints). ([FastAPI][7])

Insecure patterns:

- Per-route ad-hoc auth checks scattered through handlers (easy to miss).
- A mix of protected/unprotected endpoints with no clear policy.

Detection hints:

- Identify routers and endpoints; check whether protected ones include
  `Depends(...)`/`Security(...)`.
- Search for patterns like `if user is None: raise ...` inside handlers (instead
  of dependencies).

Fix:

- Move authentication into a dependency and attach it to the router/endpoint
  consistently using `Depends()`/`Security()`. ([FastAPI][7])

---

### FASTAPI-AUTH-002: Use standard auth transports; avoid secrets in URLs

Severity: High

Required:

- SHOULD use the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header for token auth, not
  query parameters. ([FastAPI][11])
- MUST NOT place secrets (tokens, reset links containing long-lived secrets, API
  keys) in query strings when avoidable.

Insecure patterns:

- `?token=...`, `?api_key=...`, `?auth=...` used for primary auth.
- Long-lived access tokens embedded in URLs (leak via logs, referrers, caches).

Detection hints:

- Search for parameter names like `token`, `api_key`, `key`, `secret`,
  `password`.
- Look for security schemes that use query API keys without justification.

Fix:

- Move tokens to Authorization headers; rotate/shorten lifetimes; use POST
  bodies for sensitive values.

---

### FASTAPI-AUTH-003: Password storage MUST be strongly hashed; never store plaintext passwords

Severity: Critical

Required:

- MUST store passwords using a strong, slow password hashing scheme (e.g.,
  Argon2id, bcrypt).
- MUST NOT store plaintext passwords, or reversible encryption as the primary
  protection.
- SHOULD use established libraries for hashing and verification (do not roll
  your own).

Insecure patterns:

- Storing plaintext passwords in DB.
- Using fast hashes (e.g., SHA256) without a proper password hashing KDF.
- Returning password hashes in API responses.

Detection hints:

- Search for `password=` persisted fields, and look for
  `hashlib.md5/sha1/sha256` usage on passwords.
- Inspect response models for password/hash fields.

Fix:

- Migrate to a proper password hashing library; add a re-hash-on-login upgrade
  path.

---

### FASTAPI-AUTH-004: JWT validation MUST be strict; JWTs MUST NOT carry secrets

Severity: High

Required:

- MUST validate JWT signature and enforce an algorithm allowlist.
- MUST validate standard claims appropriate to your system (at least `exp`;
  typically also `iss`/`aud` if multi-service or multi-tenant).
- MUST treat JWT contents as readable by the client; do not put secrets in JWT
  payloads. ([FastAPI][12])

Insecure patterns:

- `jwt.decode(..., options={"verify_signature": False})` or equivalent.
- Accepting `alg=none` / algorithm confusion.
- Using JWT payload to store sensitive secrets (API keys, passwords).

Detection hints:

- Search for `jwt.decode`, `python-jose`, `PyJWT`, `verify_signature`.
- Check for missing exp validation or long expirations.

Fix:

- Enforce strict validation (signature, allowed algorithms, exp, and any
  required issuer/audience constraints).
- Store only identifiers/claims you are comfortable exposing to the client.
  ([FastAPI][12])

---

### FASTAPI-AUTHZ-001: Authorization MUST be enforced per-object and per-property

Severity: High

Required:

- MUST perform object-level authorization whenever accessing a resource by
  user-controlled identifier (ID in path/query/body).
- MUST perform property-level authorization and response shaping to prevent
  “excessive data exposure” (e.g., admin-only fields). ([OWASP Foundation][13])

Insecure patterns:

- `GET /users/{id}` returns user record without verifying caller can access that
  `id`.
- Response models include internal fields (roles, permissions, billing data,
  password hashes).

Detection hints:

- Enumerate endpoints that accept IDs; trace whether an authz check is
  performed.
- Compare response models for public vs internal fields.

Fix:

- Add object-level checks (ownership, ACLs, tenant boundaries).
- Use dedicated response models that include only allowed fields.

---

### FASTAPI-SESS-001: If using cookie-based sessions and TLS, cookie attributes MUST be secure in production

Severity: High (only if TLS is enabled)

Required (production, HTTPS):

- MUST set session cookies to be sent only over HTTPS (secure). IMPORTANT NOTE:
  Only set `Secure` in production environment when TLS is configured. When
  running in a local dev environment over HTTP, do not set `Secure` property on
  cookies. You should do this conditionally based on if the app is running in
  production mode. You should also include a property like
  `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE` which can be used to disable `Secure` cookies when
  testing over HTTP.
- MUST set HttpOnly for session cookies (not accessible to JS).
- SHOULD use `SameSite=Lax` (or `Strict` if UX allows); if you require
  cross-site cookies, document the CSRF implications and add compensating
  controls. ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][8])
- If using Starlette `SessionMiddleware`, MUST set `https_only=True` in
  production and choose an appropriate `same_site`. ([PyPI][5])

Insecure patterns:

- Session cookies without Secure/HttpOnly.
- `SameSite=None` cookies used for authenticated state-changing endpoints
  without CSRF protections.

Detection hints:

- Search for `SessionMiddleware(` and inspect parameters like `https_only`,
  `same_site`.
- Search for `set_cookie(` usage and cookie flags.

Fix:

- Set secure cookie attributes; prefer short lifetimes for high-privilege
  sessions. ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][8])

---

### FASTAPI-SESS-002: Do not store sensitive secrets in signed session cookies

Severity: High

Required:

- MUST assume cookie-based session data is readable by the client (signed ≠
  encrypted); do not store secrets/PII unless encrypted server-side.
- Store only opaque identifiers (e.g., session ID) or non-sensitive state in the
  cookie; store sensitive session state server-side.
  ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][8])

Insecure patterns:

- Storing access tokens, refresh tokens, or PII directly in cookie session
  payloads.
- Treating “signed cookies” as confidential storage.

Detection hints:

- Search for `request.session[...] =` or `session[...] =`-equivalent patterns;
  identify what is stored.
- Identify use of `SessionMiddleware` or other cookie session mechanisms.

Fix:

- Move sensitive values to server-side storage; keep cookie minimal.

---

### FASTAPI-CSRF-001: Cookie-authenticated state-changing requests MUST be CSRF-protected

Severity: High

Note: This only applies if using cookie based auth. If the application uses
header or token based auth such as Authorization header, then CSRF is not an
issue.

Required:

- MUST protect all state-changing endpoints (POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE) that rely on
  cookies for authentication.
- SHOULD use a proven CSRF approach (synchronizer token pattern, or
  well-reviewed middleware) rather than rolling your own.
  ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][2])
- MAY add defense-in-depth (Origin/Referer checks, SameSite cookies, Fetch
  Metadata), but tokens are the primary defense for cookie-authenticated apps.
  ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][2])
- IMPORTANT NOTE: If cookies are not used for auth (auth is via `Authorization`
  header), CSRF is usually not applicable. ([FastAPI][11])

Insecure patterns:

- Cookie-authenticated endpoints that change state with no CSRF validation.
- Using GET for state-changing actions (amplifies CSRF risk).

Detection hints:

- Enumerate routes with methods other than GET; identify whether cookies are
  used for auth.
- Look for CSRF token generation/verification or middleware.

Fix:

- Add CSRF tokens (and validate them) on state-changing actions when cookie auth
  is in use. ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][2])

---

### FASTAPI-VALID-001: Request parsing and validation MUST be schema-driven; prevent mass assignment

Severity: Medium (especially for APIs that write to DB)

Required:

- SHOULD use Pydantic models for request bodies instead of accepting arbitrary
  `dict`/`Any`.
- SHOULD configure models to reject unexpected fields where appropriate
  (prevents “mass assignment” style bugs).
- MUST validate and normalize identifiers (IDs, email, URLs) before using them
  for access control or side effects. ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][14])

Insecure patterns:

- `payload = await request.json()` followed by `Model(**payload)` or direct DB
  writes with `payload` (no allowlist).
- Models that silently accept unknown fields for write endpoints.

Detection hints:

- Search for `await request.json()`, `request.body()`, `dict`-typed bodies,
  `Any`-typed bodies.
- Look for endpoints that do `db.update(**payload)` or `Model(**payload)` with
  unfiltered input.

Fix:

- Use explicit Pydantic models with allowlisted fields; reject extras for write
  endpoints. ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][14])

---

### FASTAPI-RESP-001: Prevent excessive data exposure via response models and explicit serialization

Severity: Medium

Required:

- MUST define response models that include only intended fields (especially for
  user objects, auth-related objects, billing objects).
- SHOULD use separate models for “create input”, “db/internal”, and “public
  output” to avoid leaking sensitive fields. ([FastAPI][15])

Insecure patterns:

- Returning ORM objects or dicts that include internal columns.
- Reusing “DB model” as the response model (includes `password_hash`,
  `is_admin`, etc).

Detection hints:

- Look for endpoints that `return user` where `user` is an ORM instance.
- Check for `response_model` omissions on endpoints that return sensitive
  resources.

Fix:

- Add explicit response models; create “public” schemas that exclude sensitive
  fields. ([FastAPI][15])

---

### FASTAPI-XSS-001: Prevent reflected/stored XSS in HTML responses and templates

Severity: High (if the service serves HTML)

Required:

- MUST use templating with auto-escaping enabled for HTML.
- MUST NOT mark untrusted content as safe (no unsafe “raw HTML” rendering of
  user-controlled data).
- SHOULD deploy a CSP when serving HTML that includes any user content.
  ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][16])

Insecure patterns:

- Rendering user content directly into HTML without escaping/sanitization.
- Disabling auto-escaping or using “raw HTML” features without sanitization.

Detection hints:

- Search for template rendering and string concatenation that builds HTML.
- Review templates for “unsafe” filters/constructs and unquoted attributes.

Fix:

- Keep auto-escaping on; sanitize user HTML only if absolutely required using a
  trusted sanitizer; add CSP. ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][16])

Note:

- If the app is a pure JSON API, XSS is usually a client/app concern, but error
  pages/docs pages might still render HTML.

---

### FASTAPI-SSTI-001: Never render untrusted templates (Server-Side Template Injection)

Severity: Critical

Required:

- MUST NOT render templates that contain user-controlled template syntax.
- MUST treat “template-from-string” rendering as dangerous if influenced by
  untrusted input.
- If untrusted templates are absolutely required (rare, high-risk):

  - MUST use a sandboxed templating approach and restrict capabilities.
  - MUST assume sandbox escapes are possible; add isolation and strict
    allowlists. ([OWASP Foundation][17])

Insecure patterns:

- Rendering templates loaded from user input or DB via a normal Jinja
  environment.
- Building templates dynamically using user-controlled strings.

Detection hints:

- Grep for Jinja `Environment.from_string`, `Template(...)`, or similar.
- Trace origin of template string (request, DB, uploads, admin panels).

Fix:

- Replace with non-executable templating (simple string substitution).
- If truly needed, use Jinja’s sandbox environment plus strong isolation.
  ([jinja.palletsprojects.com][18])

---

### FASTAPI-HEADERS-001: Set essential security headers (in app or at the edge)

Severity: Medium

Required (typical API/web app):

- SHOULD set:

  - `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
  - Clickjacking protection (`X-Frame-Options` and/or CSP `frame-ancestors`) if
    HTML is served
  - `Referrer-Policy` and `Permissions-Policy` as appropriate

NOTE:

- Headers may be set by a proxy/CDN. If not visible in app code, flag as “verify
  at edge”. ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][6])

Insecure patterns:

- No security headers anywhere (app or edge) for apps serving HTML or sensitive
  APIs.

Detection hints:

- Search for middleware that sets headers; check reverse proxy config.

Fix:

- Set headers centrally (middleware) or via reverse proxy/CDN.

---

### FASTAPI-CORS-001: CORS MUST be explicit and least-privilege

Severity: Medium (High if misconfigured with credentials)

Required:

- If CORS is not needed, MUST keep it disabled.
- If CORS is needed:

  - MUST allowlist trusted origins (do not reflect arbitrary origins).
  - MUST NOT combine credentialed requests with wildcard origins (this is unsafe
    and commonly rejected by compliant middleware).
    ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][6])
  - SHOULD restrict allowed methods and headers.

Insecure patterns:

- `allow_origins=["*"]` together with `allow_credentials=True`.
- Reflecting `Origin` without validation.
- `allow_origin_regex=".*"` used broadly.

Detection hints:

- Search for `CORSMiddleware` configuration.
- Look for `allow_origins=["*"]`, `allow_credentials=True`,
  `allow_origin_regex`.

Fix:

- Use an explicit origin allowlist and minimal methods/headers; keep credentials
  off unless required. ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][6])

---

### FASTAPI-HOST-001: Host header MUST be validated in production

Severity: Low

Required:

- SHOULD use `TrustedHostMiddleware` (or equivalent at edge) to restrict
  accepted Host values. ([PyPI][5])
- MUST NOT trust the `Host` header for security-sensitive decisions without
  validation.

Insecure patterns:

- No Host validation while generating external URLs (password reset links,
  callback URLs) from request host.
- Allowing arbitrary Host headers in apps behind permissive proxies.

Detection hints:

- Search for `TrustedHostMiddleware` usage.
- Search for logic that uses `request.url`, `request.base_url`, or host-derived
  values to build external URLs.

Fix:

- Configure a strict allowed-hosts list in production; enforce at edge too if
  possible.

---

### FASTAPI-PROXY-001: Reverse proxy trust MUST be configured correctly

Severity: High (when behind a proxy)

Required:

- If behind a reverse proxy, MUST configure forwarded-header trust correctly.
- MUST NOT blindly trust `X-Forwarded-*` headers from the open internet.
- If using Uvicorn proxy header support, MUST restrict which IPs are allowed to
  provide forwarded headers. ([PyPI][4])

Insecure patterns:

- Enabling proxy headers broadly without restricting trusted proxy IPs.
- Using forwarded headers to decide “is secure” / “is internal” / “client IP”
  without proper trust boundaries.

Detection hints:

- Search for `--proxy-headers`, `--forwarded-allow-ips`, or equivalent config.
- Search for security-sensitive use of `request.client.host`,
  `request.url.scheme`, `request.headers["x-forwarded-for"]`.

Fix:

- Configure Uvicorn with proxy headers only when behind a known proxy, and
  restrict `forwarded_allow_ips` to that proxy. ([PyPI][4])
- Keep Host allowlisting in place even behind proxies.

---

### FASTAPI-LIMITS-001: Request and multipart limits MUST be enforced to prevent DoS

Severity: Low

Required:

- MUST enforce request size limits at the edge (reverse proxy/load balancer) and
  validate in app where needed.
- MUST apply special scrutiny to multipart/form-data handling; historical
  vulnerabilities include unbounded buffering and DoS vectors.
  ([advisories.gitlab.com][9])
- SHOULD rate limit and/or add per-IP/per-user throttles for expensive
  endpoints.

Insecure patterns:

- Accepting arbitrarily large JSON bodies or multipart forms.
- Parsing multipart forms without size/field-count controls.

Detection hints:

- Identify file upload endpoints and `multipart/form-data` usage.
- Look for missing proxy-level limits (nginx `client_max_body_size`, ALB limits,
  etc.) and missing app-level checks.

Fix:

- Enforce strict body limits and multipart constraints; keep Starlette and
  python-multipart updated to patched versions. ([advisories.gitlab.com][9])

---

### FASTAPI-FILES-001: Prevent path traversal and unsafe static file exposure

Severity: High

Required:

- MUST NOT pass user-controlled file paths to `FileResponse`/filesystem calls
  without strict validation and safe base directories.
- If using `StaticFiles`, MUST keep Starlette updated and understand the
  security history (path traversal advisory exists for older versions).
  ([advisories.gitlab.com][10])
- MUST NOT serve user uploads as executable/active content (especially HTML/JS)
  from a static root without safe handling.

Insecure patterns:

- `FileResponse(request.query_params["path"])`
- Mounting `StaticFiles(directory="uploads")` where uploads include HTML/JS/SVG
  and are served inline.

Detection hints:

- Search for `FileResponse(`, `StaticFiles(`, `open(` in routes.
- Trace whether the path originates from untrusted input.

Fix:

- Use opaque IDs for files; map IDs to server-side stored paths.
- Serve untrusted content as attachment downloads where appropriate.

---

### FASTAPI-FILES-002: Mitigate Range-header DoS on file-serving endpoints

Severity: Low (if affected versions and file serving is enabled)

Required:

- MUST keep Starlette patched against known file-serving DoS issues if using
  `FileResponse`/`StaticFiles`.
- MUST treat unusual `Range` header handling and file serving as a DoS surface.
  ([advisories.gitlab.com][19])

Insecure patterns:

- Serving large files with vulnerable Starlette versions.
- No rate limiting / CDN shielding for file endpoints.

Detection hints:

- Identify Starlette version; if in affected range, flag.
- Find uses of `FileResponse` and `StaticFiles`.

Fix:

- Upgrade Starlette to a fixed version per advisory guidance.
  ([advisories.gitlab.com][19])
- Add edge caching/rate limiting for file endpoints where appropriate.

---

### FASTAPI-UPLOAD-001: File uploads MUST be validated, stored safely, and served safely

Severity: Medium

Required:

- MUST enforce upload size limits (app + edge).
- MUST validate file type using allowlists and content checks (not only
  extension). ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][20])
- SHOULD generate server-side filenames (random IDs) and avoid trusting original
  names.
- MUST serve potentially active formats safely (download attachment) unless
  explicitly intended.

Insecure patterns:

- Accepting arbitrary file types and serving them back inline.
- Using user-supplied filename as storage path.

Detection hints:

- Look for upload handlers and where/how files are written.
- Look for direct exposure of upload directories.

Fix:

- Implement allowlist validation + safe storage + safe serving; add
  scanning/quarantine if applicable. ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][20])

---

### FASTAPI-INJECT-001: Prevent SQL injection (use parameterized queries / ORM)

Severity: High

Required:

- MUST use parameterized queries or an ORM that parameterizes under the hood.
- MUST NOT build SQL by string concatenation / f-strings with untrusted input.
  ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][21])

Insecure patterns:

- `f"SELECT ... WHERE id={user_id}"`
- `"... WHERE name = '%s'" % user_input`

Detection hints:

- Grep for SQL keywords in Python strings near `.execute(...)`.
- Trace untrusted data into DB calls.

Fix:

- Replace with parameterized queries / ORM query APIs; validate types before
  querying. ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][21])

---

### FASTAPI-INJECT-002: Prevent OS command injection

Severity: Critical to High (depends on exposure)

Required:

- MUST avoid executing shell commands with untrusted input.
- If subprocess is necessary:

  - MUST pass args as a list (not a string)
  - MUST NOT use `shell=True` with attacker-influenced strings
  - SHOULD use strict allowlists for any variable component
    ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][22])

Insecure patterns:

- `os.system(user_input)`
- `subprocess.run(f"cmd {user}", shell=True)`
- Passing user strings into `bash -c`, `sh -c`, PowerShell, etc.

Detection hints:

- Search for `os.system`, `subprocess`, `Popen`, `shell=True`.
- Trace data from request/DB into these calls.

Fix:

- Use library APIs instead of shell commands.
- If unavoidable, hard-code the command and allowlist validated parameters; use
  `--` separator where supported. ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][22])

---

### FASTAPI-SSRF-001: Prevent server-side request forgery (SSRF) in outbound HTTP

Severity: Medium (can be High in cloud/VPC environments)

- Note: For small stand alone projects this is less important. It is most
  important when deploying into an LAN or with other services listening on the
  same server.

Required:

- MUST treat outbound requests to user-provided URLs as high risk.
- SHOULD validate and restrict destinations (allowlist hosts/domains) for any
  user-influenced URL fetch.
- SHOULD block access to localhost/private IP ranges/link-local and cloud
  metadata endpoints.
- MUST restrict protocols to http/https.
- SHOULD set timeouts and carefully control redirects.
  ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][23])

Insecure patterns:

- `httpx.get(request.query_params["url"])`
- “URL preview/import/webhook tester” features that accept arbitrary URLs.

Detection hints:

- Search for `requests`, `httpx`, `urllib`, `aiohttp` calls with URLs derived
  from requests/DB.
- Identify endpoints named `fetch`, `preview`, `proxy`, `webhook`, `import`.

Fix:

- Implement strict URL parsing + allowlists; add egress controls; set short
  timeouts; disable redirects if not required. ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][23])

---

### FASTAPI-REDIRECT-001: Prevent open redirects

Severity: Low

Required:

- MUST validate redirect targets derived from untrusted input (`next`,
  `redirect`, `return_to`).
- SHOULD prefer redirecting only to same-site relative paths or an allowlist of
  domains. ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][24])

Insecure patterns:

- Returning `RedirectResponse(next)` where `next` is user-controlled with no
  validation.

Detection hints:

- Search for `RedirectResponse(` or redirect logic and examine the source of the
  target.

Fix:

- Allow only relative paths or allowlisted domains; fall back to a safe default.
  ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][24])

---

### FASTAPI-WS-001: WebSocket endpoints MUST be authenticated and protected against cross-site abuse

Severity: Medium to High (depends on data/privilege)

Required:

- MUST authenticate WebSocket connections for any non-public channel (WebSockets
  don’t inherently provide auth). ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][25])
- SHOULD enforce origin/CSRF-like protections appropriate for browser-based
  WebSocket clients (Origin validation is a common control).
- SHOULD rate limit message frequency and connection attempts; close
  idle/abusive connections.

Insecure patterns:

- `@app.websocket(...)` accepts and trusts the connection with no auth check.
- Using query-string tokens for auth without considering leakage/rotation.

Detection hints:

- Search for `@app.websocket` / `websocket_endpoint` and inspect whether auth is
  performed before accepting sensitive operations.
- Review origin checks, token parsing, and per-connection authorization.

Fix:

- Require authentication during handshake (e.g., a token or session) and enforce
  authorization for actions/messages.
- Validate Origin for browser-based clients where appropriate; apply rate limits
  and timeouts. ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][25])

---

### FASTAPI-SUPPLY-001: Dependency and patch hygiene (focus on security-relevant deps)

Severity: Low

Required:

- SHOULD pin and regularly update security-critical dependencies (FastAPI,
  Starlette, Uvicorn, Pydantic, python-multipart, auth/JWT libs).
- MUST respond to known security advisories promptly.
- MUST treat file serving and multipart parsing dependencies as
  security-sensitive due to historical CVEs. ([advisories.gitlab.com][10])

Audit focus examples (historical):

- Starlette StaticFiles path traversal (fixed in 0.27.0).
  ([advisories.gitlab.com][10])
- Starlette multipart/form-data DoS (fixed in 0.40.0).
  ([advisories.gitlab.com][9])
- Starlette FileResponse Range header DoS (fixed in 0.49.1).
  ([advisories.gitlab.com][19])

Detection hints:

- Check `requirements.txt`, lockfiles, container images, and runtime
  environments for actual installed versions.
- Map file upload/file serving features to dependency versions.

Fix:

- Upgrade to patched versions per advisories; add regression tests around
  affected behavior.

---

## 5) Practical scanning heuristics (how to “hunt”)

When actively scanning, use these high-signal patterns:

- Dev server / debug:

  - `--reload`, `reload=True`, `debug=True`, `FastAPI(debug=True)` ([PyPI][4])
- OpenAPI/docs exposure:

  - `/docs`, `/redoc`, `/openapi.json`, `docs_url=`, `openapi_url=`
- Auth enforcement gaps:

  - Endpoints missing `Depends()`/`Security()` where expected; routers without a
    consistent dependency boundary ([FastAPI][7])
  - Tokens in query params (`token=`, `api_key=`, `key=`) ([FastAPI][11])
- Session/cookies + CSRF:

  - `SessionMiddleware(` and cookie flags (`https_only`, `same_site`)
    ([PyPI][5])
  - POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE handlers using cookie auth with no CSRF checks
    ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][2])
- Input validation & mass assignment:

  - `await request.json()` and direct DB writes from dicts; models accepting
    extra fields ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][14])
- Excessive data exposure:

  - Returning ORM objects or dicts without `response_model`; responses
    containing password/role/internal fields ([FastAPI][15])
- CORS:

  - `CORSMiddleware` with `allow_origins=["*"]`, `allow_origin_regex=".*"`,
    `allow_credentials=True` ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][6])
- Files:

  - `FileResponse(` with user-controlled paths; `StaticFiles(` exposing uploads
    ([advisories.gitlab.com][10])
- Uploads / multipart:

  - `multipart/form-data` endpoints with no size/field constraints; outdated
    Starlette/python-multipart ([advisories.gitlab.com][9])
- Injection:

  - SQL strings with f-strings/concatenation into `.execute(...)`
    ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][21])
  - `subprocess.*`, `shell=True`, `os.system` ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][22])
- SSRF:

  - `httpx.get/post` or `requests.*` with URL from request/DB, no
    allowlist/timeouts ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][23])
- Redirect:

  - `RedirectResponse(next)` with no validation ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][24])
- WebSockets:

  - `@app.websocket` handlers without auth/origin checks; use of `ws://` in prod
    configs ([FastAPI][27])

Always try to confirm:

- data origin (untrusted vs trusted)
- sink type (SQL/subprocess/files/template/http/redirect/ws)
- protective controls present (validation, allowlists, middleware, edge
  controls)
- installed dependency versions vs vulnerable ranges
