# Security Best Practices

## Overview

This skill provides a description of how to identify the language and frameworks
used by the current context, and then to load information from this skill's
references directory about the security best practices for this language and or
frameworks.

This information, if present, can be used to write new secure by default code,
or to passively detect major issues within existing code, or (if requested by
the user) provide a vulnerability report and suggest fixes.

## Workflow

The initial step for this skill is to identify ALL languages and ALL frameworks
which you are being asked to use or already exist in the scope of the project
you are working in. Focus on the primary core frameworks. Often you will want to
identify both frontend and backend languages and frameworks.

Then check this skill's references directory to see if there are any relevant
documentation for the language and or frameworks. Make sure you read ALL
reference files which relate to the specific framework or language. The format
of the filenames is `<language>-<framework>-<stack>-security.md`. You should
also check if there is a `<language>-general-<stack>-security.md` which is
agnostic to the framework you may be using.

If working on a web application which includes a frontend and a backend, make
sure you have checked for reference documents for BOTH the frontend and backend!

If you are asked to make a web app which will include both a frontend and
backend, but the frontend framework is not specified, also check out
`javascript-general-web-frontend-security.md`. It is important that you
understand how to secure both the frontend and backend.

If no relevant information is available in the skill's references directory,
think a little bit about what you know about the language, the framework, and
all well known security best practices for it. If you are unsure you can try to
search online for documentation on security best practices.

From there it can operate in a few ways.

1. The primary mode is to just use the information to write secure by default
   code from this point forward. This is useful for starting a new project or
   when writing new code.

2. The secondary mode is to passively detect vulnerabilities while working in
   the project and writing code for the user. Critical or very important
   vulnerabilities or major issues going against security guidance can be
   flagged and the user can be told about them. This passive mode should focus
   on the largest impact vulnerabilities and secure defaults.

3. The user can ask for a security report or to improve the security of the
   codebase. In this case a full report should be produced describe anyways the
   project fails to follow security best practices guidance. The report should
   be prioritized and have clear sections of severity and urgency. Then offer to
   start working on fixes for these issues. See #fixes below.

## Workflow Decision Tree

- If the language/framework is unclear, inspect the repo to determine it and
  list your evidence.
- If matching guidance exists in `references/`, load only the relevant files and
  follow their instructions.
- If no matching guidance exists, consider if you know any well known security
  best practices for the chosen language and or frameworks, but if asked to
  generate a report, let the user know that concrete guidance is not available
  (you can still generate the report or detect for sure critical
  vulnerabilities)

# Overrides

While these references contain the security best practices for languages and
frameworks, customers may have cases where they need to bypass or override these
practices. Pay attention to specific rules and instructions in the project's
documentation and prompt files which may require you to override certain best
practices. When overriding a best practice, you MAY report it to the user, but
do not fight with them. If a security best practice needs to be bypassed /
ignored for some project specific reason, you can also suggest to add
documentation about this to the project so it is clear why the best practice is
not being followed and to follow that bypass in the future.

# Report Format

When producing a report, you should write the report as a markdown file in
`security_best_practices_report.md` or some other location if provided by the
user. You can ask the user where they would like the report to be written to.

The report should have a short executive summary at the top.

The report should be clearly delineated into multiple sections based on severity
of the vulnerability. The report should focus on the most critical findings as
these have the highest impact for the user. All findings should be noted with an
numeric ID to make them easier to reference.

For critical findings include a one sentence impact statement.

Once the report is written, also report it to the user directly, although you
may be less verbose. You can offer to explain any of the findings or the reasons
behind the security best practices guidance if the user wants more info on any
findings.

Important: When referencing code in the report, make sure to find and include
line numbers for the code you are referencing.

After you write the report file, summarize the findings to the user.

Also tell the user where the final report was written to

# Fixes

If you produced a report, let the user read the report and ask to begin
performing fixes.

If you passively found a critical finding, notify the user and ask if they would
like you to fix this finding.

When producing fixes, focus on fixing a single finding at a time. The fixes
should have concise clear comments explaining that the new code is based on the
specific security best practice, and perhaps a very short reason why it would be
dangerous to not do it in this way.

Always consider if the changes you want to make will impact the functionality of
the user's code. Consider if the changes may cause regressions with how the
project works currently. It is often the case that insecure code is relied on
for other reasons (and this is why insecure code lives on for so long). Avoid
breaking the user's project as this may make them not want to apply security
fixes in the future. It is better to write a well thought out, well informed by
the rest of the project, fix, then a quick slapdash change.

Always follow any normal change or commit flow the user has configured. If
making git commits, provide clear commit messages explaining this is to align
with security best practices. Try to avoid bunching a number of unrelated
findings into a single commit.

Always follow any normal testing flows the user has configured (if any) to
confirm that your changes are not introducing regressions. Consider the second
order impacts the changes may have and inform the user before making them if
there are any.

# General Security Advice

Below is a few bits of secure coding advice that applies to almost any language
or framework.

### Avoid Using Incrementing IDs for Public IDs of Resources

When assigning an ID for some resource, which will then be used by exposed to
the internet, avoid using small auto-incrementing IDs. Use longer, random UUID4
or random hex string instead. This will prevent users from learning the quantity
of a resource and being able to guess resource IDs.

### A note on TLS

While TLS is important for production deployments, most development work will be
with TLS disabled or provided by some out-of-scope TLS proxy. Due to this, be
very careful about not reporting lack of TLS as a security issue. Also be very
careful around use of "secure" cookies. They should only be set if the
application will actually be over TLS. If they are set on non-TLS applications
(such as when deployed for local dev or testing), it will break the application.
You can provide a env or other flag to override setting secure as a way to keep
it off until on a TLS production deployment. Additionally avoid recommending
HSTS. It is dangerous to use without full understanding of the lasting impacts
(can cause major outages and user lockout) and it is not generally recommended
for the scope of projects being reviewed by codex.
