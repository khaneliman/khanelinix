# Develop Web Game

Build games in small steps and validate every change. Treat each iteration as:
implement → act → pause → observe → adjust.

## Skill paths (set once)

```bash
export CODEX_HOME="${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}"
export WEB_GAME_CLIENT="$CODEX_HOME/skills/develop-web-game/scripts/web_game_playwright_client.js"
export WEB_GAME_ACTIONS="$CODEX_HOME/skills/develop-web-game/references/action_payloads.json"
```

User-scoped skills install under `$CODEX_HOME/skills` (default:
`~/.codex/skills`).

## Workflow

1. **Pick a goal.** Define a single feature or behavior to implement.
2. **Implement small.** Make the smallest change that moves the game forward.
3. **Ensure integration points.** Provide a single canvas and
   `window.render_game_to_text` so the test loop can read state.
4. **Add `window.advanceTime(ms)`.** Strongly prefer a deterministic step hook
   so the Playwright script can advance frames reliably; without it, automated
   tests can be flaky.
5. **Initialize progress.md.** If `progress.md` exists, read it first and
   confirm the original user prompt is recorded at the top (prefix with
   `Original prompt:`). Also note any TODOs and suggestions left by the previous
   agent. If missing, create it and write `Original prompt: <prompt>` at the top
   before appending updates.
6. **Verify Playwright availability.** Ensure `playwright` is available (local
   dependency or global install). If unsure, check `npx` first.
7. **Run the Playwright test script.** You must run `$WEB_GAME_CLIENT` after
   each meaningful change; do not invent a new client unless required.
8. **Use the payload reference.** Base actions on `$WEB_GAME_ACTIONS` to avoid
   guessing keys.
9. **Inspect state.** Capture screenshots and text state after each burst.
10. **Inspect screenshots.** Open the latest screenshot, verify expected
    visuals, fix any issues, and rerun the script. Repeat until correct.
11. **Verify controls and state (multi-step focus).** Exhaustively exercise all
    important interactions. For each, think through the full multi-step sequence
    it implies (cause → intermediate states → outcome) and verify the entire
    chain works end-to-end. Confirm `render_game_to_text` reflects the same
    state shown on screen. If anything is off, fix and rerun. Examples of
    important interactions: move, jump, shoot/attack, interact/use,
    select/confirm/cancel in menus, pause/resume, restart, and any special
    abilities or puzzle actions defined by the request. Multi-step examples:
    shooting an enemy should reduce its health; when health reaches 0 it should
    disappear and update the score; collecting a key should unlock a door and
    allow level progression.
12. **Check errors.** Review console errors and fix the first new issue before
    continuing.
13. **Reset between scenarios.** Avoid cross-test state when validating distinct
    features.
14. **Iterate with small deltas.** Change one variable at a time (frames,
    inputs, timing, positions), then repeat steps 7–13 until stable.

Example command (actions required):

```
node "$WEB_GAME_CLIENT" --url http://localhost:5173 --actions-file "$WEB_GAME_ACTIONS" --click-selector "#start-btn" --iterations 3 --pause-ms 250
```

Example actions (inline JSON):

```json
{
  "steps": [
    {
      "buttons": ["left_mouse_button"],
      "frames": 2,
      "mouse_x": 120,
      "mouse_y": 80
    },
    { "buttons": [], "frames": 6 },
    { "buttons": ["right"], "frames": 8 },
    { "buttons": ["space"], "frames": 4 }
  ]
}
```

## Test Checklist

Test any new features added for the request and any areas your logic changes
could affect. Identify issues, fix them, and re-run the tests to confirm they’re
resolved.

Examples of things to test:

- Primary movement/interaction inputs (e.g., move, jump, shoot, confirm/select).
- Win/lose or success/fail transitions.
- Score/health/resource changes.
- Boundary conditions (collisions, walls, screen edges).
- Menu/pause/start flow if present.
- Any special actions tied to the request (powerups, combos, abilities, puzzles,
  timers).

## Test Artifacts to Review

- Latest screenshots from the Playwright run.
- Latest `render_game_to_text` JSON output.
- Console error logs (fix the first new error before continuing). You must
  actually open and visually inspect the latest screenshots after running the
  Playwright script, not just generate them. Ensure everything that should be
  visible on screen is actually visible. Go beyond the start screen and capture
  gameplay screenshots that cover all newly added features. Treat the
  screenshots as the source of truth; if something is missing, it is missing in
  the build. If you suspect a headless/WebGL capture issue, rerun the Playwright
  script in headed mode and re-check. Fix and rerun in a tight loop until the
  screenshots and text state look correct. Once fixes are verified, re-test all
  important interactions and controls, confirm they work, and ensure your
  changes did not introduce regressions. If they did, fix them and rerun
  everything in a loop until interactions, text state, and controls all work as
  expected. Be exhaustive in testing controls; broken games are not acceptable.

## Core Game Guidelines

### Canvas + Layout

- Prefer a single canvas centered in the window.

### Visuals

- Keep on-screen text minimal; show controls on a start/menu screen rather than
  overlaying them during play.
- Avoid overly dark scenes unless the design calls for it. Make key elements
  easy to see.
- Draw the background on the canvas itself instead of relying on CSS
  backgrounds.

### Text State Output (render_game_to_text)

Expose a `window.render_game_to_text` function that returns a concise JSON
string representing the current game state. The text should include enough
information to play the game without visuals.

Minimal pattern:

```js
function renderGameToText() {
  const payload = {
    mode: state.mode,
    player: { x: state.player.x, y: state.player.y, r: state.player.r },
    entities: state.entities.map((e) => ({ x: e.x, y: e.y, r: e.r })),
    score: state.score,
  };
  return JSON.stringify(payload);
}
window.render_game_to_text = renderGameToText;
```

Keep the payload succinct and biased toward on-screen/interactive elements.
Prefer current, visible entities over full history. Include a clear coordinate
system note (origin and axis directions), and encode all player-relevant state:
player position/velocity, active obstacles/enemies, collectibles,
timers/cooldowns, score, and any mode/state flags needed to make correct
decisions. Avoid large histories; only include what's currently relevant and
visible.

### Time Stepping Hook

Provide a deterministic time-stepping hook so the Playwright client can advance
the game in controlled increments. Expose `window.advanceTime(ms)` (or a thin
wrapper that forwards to your game update loop) and have the game loop use it
when present. The Playwright test script uses this hook to step frames
deterministically during automated testing.

Minimal pattern:

```js
window.advanceTime = (ms) => {
  const steps = Math.max(1, Math.round(ms / (1000 / 60)));
  for (let i = 0; i < steps; i++) update(1 / 60);
  render();
};
```

### Fullscreen Toggle

- Use a single key (prefer `f`) to toggle fullscreen on/off.
- Allow `Esc` to exit fullscreen.
- When fullscreen toggles, resize the canvas/rendering so visuals and input
  mapping stay correct.

## Progress Tracking

Create a `progress.md` file if it doesn't exist, and append TODOs, notes,
gotchas, and loose ends as you go so another agent can pick up seamlessly. If a
`progress.md` file already exists, read it first, including the original user
prompt at the top (you may be continuing another agent's work). Do not overwrite
the original prompt; preserve it. Update `progress.md` after each meaningful
chunk of work (feature added, bug found, test run, or decision made). At the end
of your work, leave TODOs and suggestions for the next agent in `progress.md`.

## Playwright Prerequisites

- Prefer a local `playwright` dependency if the project already has it.
- If unsure whether Playwright is available, check for `npx`:
  ```
  command -v npx >/dev/null 2>&1
  ```
- If `npx` is missing, install Node/npm and then install Playwright globally:
  ```
  npm install -g @playwright/mcp@latest
  ```
- Do not switch to `@playwright/test` unless explicitly asked; stick to the
  client script.

## Scripts

- `$WEB_GAME_CLIENT` (installed default:
  `$CODEX_HOME/skills/develop-web-game/scripts/web_game_playwright_client.js`) —
  Playwright-based action loop with virtual-time stepping, screenshot capture,
  and console error buffering. You must pass an action burst via
  `--actions-file`, `--actions-json`, or `--click`.

## References

- `$WEB_GAME_ACTIONS` (installed default:
  `$CODEX_HOME/skills/develop-web-game/references/action_payloads.json`) —
  example action payloads (keyboard + mouse, per-frame capture). Use these to
  build your burst.
