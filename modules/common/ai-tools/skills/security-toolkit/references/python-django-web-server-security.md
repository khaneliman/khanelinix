# Django (Python) Web Security Spec (Django 6.0.x, Python 3.x)

This document is designed as a **security spec** that supports:

1. **Secure-by-default code generation** for new Django code.
2. **Security review / vulnerability hunting** in existing Django code (passive
   “notice issues while working” and active “scan the repo and report
   findings”).

It is intentionally written as a set of **normative requirements**
(“MUST/SHOULD/MAY”) plus **audit rules** (what bad patterns look like, how to
detect them, and how to fix/mitigate them).

---

## 0) Safety, boundaries, and anti-abuse constraints (MUST FOLLOW)

- MUST NOT request, output, log, or commit secrets (API keys, passwords, private
  keys, session cookies, `SECRET_KEY`, `SECRET_KEY_FALLBACKS`, database
  passwords).
- MUST NOT “fix” security by disabling protections (e.g., removing
  `CsrfViewMiddleware`, sprinkling `@csrf_exempt`, loosening `ALLOWED_HOSTS` to
  `['*']`, disabling `SecurityMiddleware`, disabling template auto-escaping,
  disabling permission checks).
- MUST provide **evidence-based findings** during audits: cite file paths, code
  snippets, and concrete configuration values that justify the claim.
- MUST treat uncertainty honestly: if a protection might exist in infrastructure
  (reverse proxy, WAF, CDN, ingress controller), report it as “not visible in
  app code; verify at runtime / edge config”.
- MUST keep fixes compatible with Django’s intended security model: prefer
  Django’s built-ins (middleware, auth, forms, ORM) over custom security logic
  whenever possible. Django’s deployment checklist and system checks are part of
  the intended model. ([Django Project][1])

---

## 1) Operating modes

### 1.1 Generation mode (default)

When asked to write new Django code or modify existing code:

- MUST follow every **MUST** requirement in this spec.
- SHOULD follow every **SHOULD** requirement unless the user explicitly says
  otherwise.
- MUST prefer safe-by-default Django APIs and proven libraries over custom
  security code.
- MUST avoid introducing new risky sinks (dynamic template rendering from
  untrusted strings, unsafe redirects, unsafe file serving, shell execution, raw
  SQL string formatting, SSRF-capable URL fetchers from untrusted input).

### 1.2 Passive review mode (always on while editing)

While working anywhere in a Django repo (even if the user did not ask for a
security scan):

- MUST “notice” violations of this spec in touched/nearby code.
- SHOULD mention issues as they come up, with a brief explanation + safe fix.

### 1.3 Active audit mode (explicit scan request)

When the user asks to “scan”, “audit”, or “hunt for vulns”:

- MUST systematically search the codebase for violations of this spec.
- MUST output findings in a structured format (see §2.3).

Recommended audit order:

1. Deployment entrypoints (ASGI/WSGI), Dockerfiles, Procfiles, systemd units,
   platform manifests.
2. `settings.py` and environment-specific settings modules.
3. Middleware ordering and enabled protections.
4. Authn/authz (login, session management, permissions, admin).
5. CSRF protections and state-changing endpoints.
6. Templates and XSS.
7. File handling (uploads/downloads/static/media) and path traversal.
8. Injection classes (SQL, command execution, unsafe deserialization).
9. Outbound requests (SSRF).
10. Redirect handling (open redirects) + CORS + security headers (CSP, HSTS,
    etc.).
11. Dependency/pinning and patch posture.

---

## 2) Definitions and review guidance

### 2.1 Untrusted input (treat as attacker-controlled unless proven otherwise)

Examples include:

- `request.GET`, `request.POST`, `request.FILES`
- `request.body`, JSON bodies (e.g., `json.loads(request.body)`), DRF
  `request.data`
- URL path parameters (e.g., `<int:id>`, `<slug:...>`)
- `request.headers` / `request.META` (including `HTTP_HOST`, `HTTP_ORIGIN`,
  `HTTP_REFERER`, `HTTP_X_FORWARDED_*`)
- `request.COOKIES`
- Any data from external systems (webhooks, third-party APIs, message queues)
- Any persisted content that originated from users (DB rows, cached content,
  file uploads)

Django explicitly emphasizes “never trust user-controlled data” and recommends
using forms/validation. ([Django Project][2])

### 2.2 State-changing request

A request is state-changing if it can create/update/delete data, change
auth/session state, trigger side effects (purchase, email send, webhook send),
or initiate privileged actions.

### 2.3 Required audit finding format

For each issue found, output:

- Rule ID:
- Severity: Critical / High / Medium / Low
- Location: file path + function/class/view name + line(s)
- Evidence: the exact code/config snippet
- Impact: what could go wrong, who can exploit it
- Fix: safe change (prefer minimal diff)
- Mitigation: defense-in-depth if immediate fix is hard
- False positive notes: what to verify if uncertain

---

## 3) Secure baseline: minimum production configuration (MUST in production)

This is the smallest “production baseline” that prevents common Django
misconfigurations. Django provides a “Deployment checklist” and recommends
running `manage.py check --deploy` against production settings.
([Django Project][1])

### 3.1 Settings management pattern (SHOULD)

- SHOULD use environment-based configuration (or a secret manager) so production
  settings are not hard-coded.
- MUST treat sensitive settings as confidential (e.g., `SECRET_KEY`, DB
  passwords) and keep them out of source control. Django’s checklist explicitly
  recommends loading `SECRET_KEY` from env or a file rather than hardcoding.
  ([Django Project][1])
- SHOULD separate dev vs prod settings modules, with safe defaults for
  production (fail closed if critical settings are missing).
  ([Django Project][1])

### 3.2 Minimum baseline targets (production)

- MUST NOT use `manage.py runserver` as the production entrypoint; use a
  production-ready WSGI or ASGI server. ([Django Project][1])
- MUST set `DEBUG = False` in production. ([Django Project][1])
- MUST set a strong, secret `SECRET_KEY` and keep it secret; MAY use
  `SECRET_KEY_FALLBACKS` for safe rotation. ([Django Project][1])
- MUST set `ALLOWED_HOSTS` to expected hosts (no wildcard unless you do your own
  host validation). ([Django Project][1])
- MUST enforce HTTPS for authenticated areas (ideally site-wide for any
  login-capable app) and set `CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE=True` and
  `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=True` when HTTPS is used. ([Django Project][1])
- SHOULD enable key `SecurityMiddleware` headers/settings: HSTS,
  Referrer-Policy, COOP, nosniff, SSL redirect (with correct proxy
  configuration). ([Django Project][3])
- MUST treat user uploads as untrusted; ensure your web server never interprets
  them as executable content; keep `MEDIA_ROOT` separate from `STATIC_ROOT`.
  ([Django Project][1])

---

## 4) Rules (generation + audit)

Each rule contains: required practice, insecure patterns, detection hints, and
remediation.

### DJANGO-DEPLOY-001: Do not use Django’s development server in production

Severity: High (if production)

Required:

- MUST NOT deploy `manage.py runserver` as the production server.
- MUST run behind a production-grade WSGI or ASGI server. ([Django Project][1])

Insecure patterns:

- Production docs/scripts using `python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000`.
- Docker `CMD`/entrypoint uses `runserver`.
- Kubernetes/Procfile/systemd units invoking `runserver`.

Detection hints:

- Search for `manage.py runserver`, `runserver 0.0.0.0`, `--insecure`.
- Check Docker `CMD/ENTRYPOINT`, Procfile, systemd unit files, Helm charts.

Fix:

- Use a production server (WSGI/ASGI) as recommended in Django’s deployment
  checklist. ([Django Project][1])

Note:

- `runserver` is fine for local development. Only flag if it’s used as the
  production entrypoint.

---

### DJANGO-DEPLOY-002: `DEBUG` MUST be disabled in production

Severity: High

Required:

- MUST set `DEBUG = False` in production.
- MUST treat any mechanism that exposes debug pages/tracebacks to untrusted
  users as a critical information disclosure risk. Django’s checklist explicitly
  warns `DEBUG=True` leaks source excerpts, local variables, settings, and more.
  ([Django Project][1])

Insecure patterns:

- `DEBUG = True` in production settings.
- Environment defaults to `DEBUG=True` unless explicitly overridden.

Detection hints:

- Search `DEBUG = True`, `DEBUG=os.environ.get(..., True)`, `DJANGO_DEBUG`,
  `.env` files.
- Look for “production” settings modules that import from dev defaults.

Fix:

- Set `DEBUG=False` in prod settings; use explicit environment config.
- Ensure error reporting is via safe logging/monitoring, not debug pages.
  ([Django Project][1])

---

### DJANGO-CONFIG-001: `SECRET_KEY` must be strong, secret, and rotated safely

Severity: High (Critical if missing in production with signing/sessions)

Required:

- MUST set a large random `SECRET_KEY` in production and keep it secret.
  ([Django Project][1])
- MUST NOT commit it to source control or print/log it. ([Django Project][1])
- SHOULD load it from env or a file/secret store (not hard-coded).
  ([Django Project][1])
- MAY rotate keys using `SECRET_KEY_FALLBACKS` to avoid instantly invalidating
  all signed data; MUST remove old keys from fallbacks in a timely manner.
  ([Django Project][1])

Insecure patterns:

- Hard-coded `SECRET_KEY = "..."` in repo for production.
- `SECRET_KEY` reused across environments.
- `SECRET_KEY_FALLBACKS` contains long-expired keys indefinitely.

Detection hints:

- Search for `SECRET_KEY =`, `SECRET_KEY_FALLBACKS`, `.env` committed files,
  `print(settings.SECRET_KEY)`.

Fix:

- Load from secret manager / environment variable.
- If rotating:

  - Set new `SECRET_KEY`
  - Keep old key(s) temporarily in `SECRET_KEY_FALLBACKS`
  - Remove old key(s) after the rotation window. ([Django Project][1])

---

### DJANGO-HOST-001: Host header must be validated (`ALLOWED_HOSTS` must be strict)

Severity: Medium

Required:

- MUST set `ALLOWED_HOSTS` in production to your expected domains/hosts.
  ([Django Project][1])
- MUST NOT set `ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['*']` in production unless you also implement
  your own robust `Host` validation (Django warns that wildcards require your
  own validation to avoid CSRF-class attacks). ([Django Project][1])
- SHOULD configure the fronting web server to reject unknown hosts early
  (defense-in-depth). ([Django Project][1])

Insecure patterns:

- `ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['*']` (or env expands to `*`) in production.
- `ALLOWED_HOSTS = []` with `DEBUG=False` (site won’t run, or misconfigured
  deployments attempt workarounds).

Detection hints:

- Search `ALLOWED_HOSTS`.
- Check platform environment settings that override `ALLOWED_HOSTS`.

Fix:

- Set `ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['example.com', 'www.example.com', ...]` for prod.
- Keep dev hosts separate.

Notes:

- Django uses the Host header for URL construction; fake Host values can lead to
  CSRF, cache poisoning, and poisoned email links (Django security docs call
  this out). ([Django Project][2])

---

### DJANGO-HTTPS-001: If TLS is used cookie transport must be secured

Severity: High (Critical for auth-enabled apps)

NOTE: Only enforce this if TLS is enabled, as it will break non-TLS applications

If using TLS:

- MUST set:

  - `CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE = True` ([Django Project][1])
  - `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = True` ([Django Project][1])
- SHOULD consider enabling:

  - `SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT = True` (with correct proxy config)
    ([Django Project][3])
  - HSTS via `SECURE_HSTS_SECONDS` (+ includeSubDomains/preload as appropriate).
    ([Django Project][3])

Insecure patterns:

- Login pages over HTTP, or mixed HTTP/HTTPS with the same session cookie.
- `CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE=False` or `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=False` in production
  HTTPS.
- HSTS enabled incorrectly (can break site for the duration).

Detection hints:

- Inspect `settings.py` for `CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE`, `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE`,
  `SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT`, `SECURE_HSTS_SECONDS`.
- Inspect proxy/ingress config for HTTP->HTTPS redirect behavior.

Fix:

- Enable HTTPS redirect and secure cookies.
- Add HSTS carefully (start with low value, validate, then increase). Django
  warns misconfig can break your site for the HSTS duration.
  ([Django Project][3])

---

### DJANGO-PROXY-001: Reverse proxy trust must be configured correctly (`SECURE_PROXY_SSL_HEADER`)

Severity: Medium (when behind a TLS proxy)

Required:

- If behind a reverse proxy that terminates TLS, MUST configure Django so
  `request.is_secure()` reflects the _external_ scheme, otherwise CSRF and other
  logic can break. Django documents using `SECURE_PROXY_SSL_HEADER` for this.
  ([Django Project][3])
- MUST only set `SECURE_PROXY_SSL_HEADER` if you control the proxy (or have
  guarantees) and it strips inbound spoofed headers. Django explicitly warns
  misconfig can compromise security and lists required conditions.
  ([Django Project][3])

Insecure patterns:

- `SECURE_PROXY_SSL_HEADER = ("HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PROTO", "https")` in an
  environment where the proxy does not strip user-supplied `X-Forwarded-Proto`.
- Infinite redirect loops after setting `SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT=True` (often
  indicates proxy HTTPS detection is wrong). ([Django Project][3])

Detection hints:

- Search `SECURE_PROXY_SSL_HEADER`, `SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT`.
- Inspect ingress/proxy behavior for stripping forwarded headers.

Fix:

- Set `SECURE_PROXY_SSL_HEADER` only if the proxy strips and sets the header
  correctly (per Django’s documented prerequisites). ([Django Project][3])

---

### DJANGO-SESS-001: Session cookies must use secure attributes in production

Severity: Medium (Only if TLS enabled)

Required (production, HTTPS):

- MUST set `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=True` (only transmit over HTTPS).
  ([Django Project][3])
- MUST keep `SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY=True` (Django default is `True`).
  ([Django Project][3])
- SHOULD keep `SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE='Lax'` (Django default is `Lax`) unless a
  justified cross-site flow requires `None`. ([Django Project][3])
- SHOULD avoid setting `SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN` unless you truly need
  cross-subdomain cookies (subdomain-wide cookies expand attack surface).

Insecure patterns:

- `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=False` in production HTTPS.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Only set `Secure` in production environment when TLS is
configured. When running in a local dev environment over HTTP, do not set
`Secure` property on cookies. You should do this conditionally based on if the
app is running in production mode. You should also include a property like
`SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE` which can be used to disable `Secure` cookies when
testing over HTTP.

- `SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY=False`.
- `SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE=None` combined with cookie-authenticated
  state-changing endpoints (higher CSRF risk).

Detection hints:

- Search for `SESSION_COOKIE_` settings,
  `response.set_cookie(..., httponly=..., secure=..., samesite=...)`.

Fix:

- Set the above explicitly in production settings.
- Validate compatibility with your auth flows. ([Django Project][3])

---

### DJANGO-SESS-002: CSRF cookie settings must be deliberate (HttpOnly has tradeoffs)

Severity: Medium

Required:

- SHOULD set `CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE=True` when using HTTPS/TLS.
  ([Django Project][3])
- SHOULD keep `CSRF_COOKIE_SAMESITE='Lax'` unless you have a cross-site
  requirement. Django default is `Lax`. ([Django Project][3])
- MAY set `CSRF_COOKIE_HTTPONLY=True` (default is `False`) if your frontend does
  not need to read the CSRF cookie. If you enable it, your JS must read the CSRF
  token from the DOM instead (Django documents this). ([Django Project][3])

Insecure patterns:

- `CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE=False` in production HTTPS/TLS.
- Setting `CSRF_COOKIE_HTTPONLY=True` but still relying on “read csrftoken
  cookie in JS” patterns (breaks CSRF for AJAX).
- `CSRF_COOKIE_SAMESITE=None` without a clear reason.

Detection hints:

- Search for `CSRF_COOKIE_` settings.
- Search JS for `document.cookie` usage to fetch `csrftoken`.

Fix:

- Align cookie settings with your CSRF token acquisition method (cookie vs DOM)
  as Django describes. ([Django Project][4])

---

### DJANGO-CSRF-001: Cookie-authenticated state-changing requests MUST be CSRF-protected

Severity: High

Required:

- MUST keep `django.middleware.csrf.CsrfViewMiddleware` enabled (it is activated
  by default). ([Django Project][4])
- MUST include `{% csrf_token %}` in internal POST forms; MUST NOT include it in
  forms that POST to external URLs (Django warns this leaks the token).
  ([Django Project][4])
- MUST protect all state-changing endpoints (POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE) that rely on
  cookies for authentication.
- For AJAX/SPA calls, MUST send the CSRF token via the `X-CSRFToken` header (or
  configured header name) as documented. ([Django Project][4])
- MUST be very careful with `@csrf_exempt` and use it only when absolutely
  necessary; if used, MUST replace CSRF with an appropriate alternative control
  (e.g., request signing for webhooks). Django explicitly warns about
  `csrf_exempt`. ([Django Project][2])

Insecure patterns:

- Missing `CsrfViewMiddleware` in `MIDDLEWARE`.
- `@csrf_exempt` on general-purpose authenticated views.
- POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE endpoints with session auth and no CSRF tokens.
- Using GET for state-changing actions (amplifies CSRF risk).

Detection hints:

- Inspect `settings.py` `MIDDLEWARE` for `CsrfViewMiddleware` and its order
  (Django notes it should come before middleware that assumes CSRF is handled).
  ([Django Project][4])
- Search for `csrf_exempt`, `csrf_protect`, `ensure_csrf_cookie`.
- Enumerate URL patterns for non-GET methods; confirm CSRF coverage.

Fix:

- Re-enable `CsrfViewMiddleware`, add CSRF tokens to forms, and add AJAX header
  handling.
- For caching decorators: if you cache a view that needs CSRF tokens, apply
  `@csrf_protect` as Django documents to avoid caching a response without CSRF
  cookie/Vary headers. ([Django Project][4])

Notes:

- When deployed with HTTPS, Django’s CSRF middleware also checks the Referer
  header for same-origin (Django security docs mention this).
  ([Django Project][2])

---

### DJANGO-XSS-001: Prevent reflected/stored XSS in templates and HTML generation

Severity: High

Required:

- MUST rely on Django template auto-escaping (safe-by-default) for HTML
  templates. Django security docs highlight that Django templates escape
  dangerous characters but have limitations. ([Django Project][2])
- MUST NOT disable auto-escaping broadly (`{% autoescape off %}`) unless the
  content is trusted or safely sanitized. ([Django Project][5])
- MUST NOT mark untrusted content as safe:

  - Avoid `mark_safe(...)` on user data.
  - Avoid `|safe` on user-controlled content.
- MUST be careful about HTML context pitfalls (e.g., unquoted attributes);
  Django explicitly shows an example where escaping does not protect an unquoted
  attribute context. ([Django Project][2])
- SHOULD prefer safe HTML construction helpers (e.g., `format_html`) rather than
  manual concatenation that risks missing escapes. ([Django Project][6])

Insecure patterns:

- `{% autoescape off %}{{ user_input }}{% endautoescape %}`
- `{{ user_input|safe }}`
- `mark_safe(request.GET["q"])`
- Unquoted attribute injections: `<style class={{ var }}>...` (Django’s own
  example). ([Django Project][2])

Detection hints:

- Search templates for `|safe`, `autoescape off`, `safeseq`.
- Search Python for `mark_safe`, `SafeString`, or direct HTML concatenation with
  request/DB values.
- Review any code returning `HttpResponse(user_value)` where `user_value`
  contains HTML.

Fix:

- Remove unsafe marking; sanitize only when strictly necessary (use an
  allowlist-based HTML sanitizer).
- Quote attributes and avoid placing untrusted values into dangerous contexts.
- Add CSP as defense-in-depth (see DJANGO-CSP-001). ([Django Project][2])

---

### DJANGO-TEMPLATE-001: Never render untrusted template source strings

Severity: High to Critical (depends on context and exposure)

Required:

- MUST NOT render templates where the template source string is influenced by
  untrusted input (request, user content, DB rows editable by untrusted users).
- MUST treat “template from string” patterns as dangerous, even if Django
  templates are more constrained than some other engines: they can still leak
  data from context, bypass escaping, and create XSS or content injection.

Insecure patterns:

- `Template(request.GET["tmpl"]).render(Context(...))`
- Saving user templates in the DB and rendering them with normal
  privileges/context.

Detection hints:

- Search for `django.template.Template(`, `Engine.from_string`,
  `.render(Context(` with non-constant strings.
- Trace where the template string comes from (admin panels, DB, uploads,
  requests).

Fix:

- Replace with non-executing formatting (e.g., `string.Template`, explicit
  placeholders) or a strict allowlisted rendering model.
- If you _must_ support user-defined templates, isolate heavily (separate
  service/tenant context, strict allowlists, and assume bypasses are possible).

---

### DJANGO-SQL-001: Prevent SQL injection (use ORM or parameterized raw SQL)

Severity: High

Required:

- MUST use Django ORM/querysets for normal DB access; Django notes querysets are
  parameterized and protected from SQL injection under typical use.
  ([Django Project][2])
- MUST be very careful with raw SQL; if using `raw()`, `cursor.execute()`,
  `extra()`, or `RawSQL`, MUST pass parameters separately (e.g., `params=`) and
  MUST NOT string-interpolate untrusted input into SQL. Django’s raw SQL docs
  warn to escape user-controlled parameters using `params`.
  ([Django Project][7])
- MUST NOT quote placeholders in SQL templates (Django docs explicitly warn that
  quoting `%s` placeholders makes it unsafe). ([Django Project][8])
- SHOULD avoid `extra()` and `RawSQL` unless necessary; Django security docs
  call for caution. ([Django Project][2])

Insecure patterns:

- `cursor.execute(f"SELECT ... WHERE id={request.GET['id']}")`
- `Model.objects.raw("... %s" % user_input)` (string formatting)
- `extra(where=[f"headline='{q}'"])`
- Quoted placeholders: `WHERE othercol = '%s'` (explicitly documented as
  unsafe). ([Django Project][8])

Detection hints:

- Grep for `.raw(`, `.extra(`, `RawSQL(`, `connection.cursor()`, `.execute(`.
- Grep for SQL keywords (`SELECT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `INSERT`) in Python
  strings.
- Track untrusted inputs into these call sites.

Fix:

- Prefer ORM queries.
- If raw SQL is unavoidable, use parameters (`params`, DB-API param binding) and
  do not quote placeholders. ([Django Project][7])

---

### DJANGO-CMD-001: Prevent OS command injection

Severity: Critical to High (depends on exposure)

Required:

- MUST avoid executing system commands with attacker-influenced input.
- If subprocess is necessary:

  - MUST pass args as a list (not a shell string).
  - MUST NOT use `shell=True` with attacker-influenced content.
  - SHOULD use strict allowlists for variable components.
- SHOULD prefer pure-Python libraries instead of shelling out.

Insecure patterns:

- `os.system(request.GET["cmd"])`
- `subprocess.run(f"convert {path}", shell=True)` where `path` is
  user-controlled.

Detection hints:

- Search `os.system`, `subprocess`, `Popen`, `shell=True`.
- Trace request/DB inputs into those calls.

Fix:

- Replace with library APIs; if unavoidable, hard-code executable and allowlist
  validated parameters.

---

### DJANGO-UPLOAD-001: File uploads must be validated, stored safely, and served safely

Severity: High

Required:

- MUST treat all user uploads as untrusted. Django explicitly warns “Media files
  are uploaded by your users. They’re untrusted!” ([Django Project][1])
- MUST ensure the web server never interprets user uploads as executable code
  (e.g., don’t allow uploaded `.php` or HTML to execute/inline as active
  content). ([Django Project][1])
- MUST enforce size limits (at least at the web server; Django security docs
  recommend limiting upload size at the server to prevent DoS).
  ([Django Project][2])
- SHOULD validate file types using allowlists and content checks (not only
  extensions).
- SHOULD store uploads outside the application code directory and outside any
  static root.
- SHOULD consider serving uploads from a separate top-level/second-level domain
  to reduce same-origin impact; Django security docs recommend a distinct domain
  and note that a subdomain may be insufficient for some protections.
  ([Django Project][2])
- MUST be aware of polyglot upload risks: Django documents a case where HTML can
  be uploaded “as an image” by using a valid PNG header (and may be served as
  HTML depending on the web server). ([Django Project][2])

Insecure patterns:

- Serving uploads inline with `text/html` or without forcing download for
  potentially active formats.
- Upload allowlist based only on extension.
- Upload storage inside static roots or code roots.

Detection hints:

- Search for `request.FILES`, `FileField`, `ImageField`, upload forms/views.
- Inspect upload serving paths and Nginx/Apache config (media handlers).
- Check `MEDIA_URL`, `MEDIA_ROOT`, and static config.

Fix:

- Configure the web server to serve uploads as inert bytes (no execution), and
  consider forcing `Content-Disposition: attachment` for risky types.
- Use a separate domain for user content when warranted. ([Django Project][2])

---

### DJANGO-PATH-001: Prevent path traversal and unsafe file serving (static/media separation)

Severity: High

Required:

- MUST NOT treat user input as a filesystem path for reads/writes/serving.
- MUST keep `MEDIA_ROOT` and `STATIC_ROOT` distinct; Django settings docs
  explicitly warn they must have different values to avoid security
  implications. ([Django Project][3])
- SHOULD prefer using Django storage APIs keyed by server-side identifiers
  rather than accepting arbitrary relative paths from users.

Insecure patterns:

- `open(os.path.join(MEDIA_ROOT, request.GET["path"]))`
- Download endpoints that take `?file=../../...` style parameters.
- Misconfigured `MEDIA_ROOT == STATIC_ROOT`.

Detection hints:

- Grep for `open(`, `Path(`, `os.path.join(` used with request values.
- Check `MEDIA_ROOT`, `STATIC_ROOT` in settings. ([Django Project][3])

Fix:

- Use server-side IDs mapped to known files.
- Keep static and media separated and ensure the web server treats media as
  untrusted. ([Django Project][3])

---

### DJANGO-REDIRECT-001: Prevent open redirects (`next`, `return_to`, `redirect`)

Severity: Medium (High when combined with auth flows)

Required:

- MUST validate redirect targets derived from untrusted input (e.g., `next`,
  `return_to`).
- SHOULD restrict to same-site relative paths or allowlisted hosts/schemes.
- SHOULD use Django’s safe URL helpers (e.g.,
  `django.utils.http.url_has_allowed_host_and_scheme`) rather than custom
  parsing.

Insecure patterns:

- `return redirect(request.GET.get("next"))` with no validation.
- Redirect allowlist implemented with naive string checks.

Detection hints:

- Search for `redirect(` and track origin of the target.
- Search for parameters named `next`, `return_to`, `redirect`, `url`.

Fix:

- Validate with allowlists and default to a safe internal path if validation
  fails.
- Ensure host validation via `ALLOWED_HOSTS` remains strict (see
  DJANGO-HOST-001). ([Django Project][3])

---

### DJANGO-HEADERS-001: Enable essential security headers (SecurityMiddleware + clickjacking protection)

Severity: Medium to High

Required:

- SHOULD use `django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware` and configure it
  appropriately (production) for:

  - `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` (Django setting
    `SECURE_CONTENT_TYPE_NOSNIFF`, default `True`). ([Django Project][3])
  - `Referrer-Policy` (Django setting `SECURE_REFERRER_POLICY`, default
    `'same-origin'`). ([Django Project][3])
  - COOP (Django setting `SECURE_CROSS_ORIGIN_OPENER_POLICY`, default
    `'same-origin'`). ([Django Project][3])
  - HTTPS redirects and HSTS as appropriate (see DJANGO-HTTPS-001).
    ([Django Project][3])
- SHOULD enable clickjacking protection via X-Frame-Options middleware; Django
  security docs strongly recommend it for sites that don’t need third-party
  framing. ([Django Project][2])

Insecure patterns:

- Missing SecurityMiddleware.
- Missing clickjacking protection (or disabling it globally) without a clear
  framing requirement.
- Over-broad framing allowances for sensitive endpoints.

Detection hints:

- Inspect `MIDDLEWARE` for SecurityMiddleware and XFrameOptionsMiddleware.
- Search for per-view disabling of framing/CSRF protections.

Fix:

- Add/enable middleware and configure the settings intentionally.
  ([Django Project][3])

NOTE:

- Some headers may be set at the edge (CDN/reverse proxy). If not visible in app
  code, flag as “verify at edge”.

---

### DJANGO-CSP-001: Deploy a Content Security Policy (CSP) as defense-in-depth

Severity: Medium (High for apps rendering untrusted content)

NOTE: It is most important to set the CSP's script-src. All other directives are
not as important and can generally be excluded for the ease of development.

Required:

- SHOULD deploy a CSP to mitigate XSS and content injection classes; Django’s
  security docs recommend CSP and note it is new in Django 6.0.
  ([Django Project][2])
- MUST understand CSP limitations:

  - Avoid excluding routes from CSP coverage; Django warns that an unprotected
    page can undermine protected pages due to same-origin policy.
    ([Django Project][2])
- MAY start with `SECURE_CSP_REPORT_ONLY` to iterate safely (Django provides
  report-only support). ([Django Project][3])

Insecure patterns:

- No CSP on apps that render user-controlled content.
- CSP excludes “just a couple pages” (weakens overall protection), especially
  pages with any injection surface. ([Django Project][2])
- CSP uses overly permissive directives (e.g., widespread `unsafe-inline`)
  without justification.

Detection hints:

- Search `SECURE_CSP`, `SECURE_CSP_REPORT_ONLY`, and CSP middleware
  configuration.
- Inspect reverse proxy/CDN config for CSP headers.

Fix:

- Implement a realistic CSP, ideally report-only first, then enforce.
  ([Django Project][3])

### DJANGO-AUTH-001: Password storage must use Django’s secure hashers; password policy must be configured

Severity: High

Required:

- MUST use Django’s built-in password hashing (never store plaintext or
  reversible encrypted passwords).
- SHOULD prefer modern hashers and keep defaults updated; Django documents
  `PASSWORD_HASHERS` and includes modern options (Argon2, bcrypt, scrypt, PBKDF2
  variants). ([Django Project][3])
- SHOULD configure `AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS` (default is empty) for production
  password policy. ([Django Project][3])

Insecure patterns:

- Custom password storage or hashing.
- Plaintext passwords stored in DB fields.
- No password validation on consumer-facing apps.

Detection hints:

- Search for `.set_password(` usage vs manual hashing.
- Inspect settings for `PASSWORD_HASHERS` and `AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS`.
  ([Django Project][3])

Fix:

- Use Django auth user model APIs.
- Enable password validators appropriate to the product’s risk profile.
  ([Django Project][3])

---

### DJANGO-AUTHZ-001: Authorization must be explicit and consistent

Severity: High

Required:

- MUST enforce authorization checks on every privileged action (view, modify,
  admin-like operations).
- MUST NOT rely on UI-only restrictions (e.g., hiding buttons) without
  server-side permission checks.
- SHOULD use Django’s permissions/groups and per-object authorization patterns
  where applicable.

Insecure patterns:

- Views that assume “user is logged in” implies “user may do action”.
- Missing authorization checks on update/delete endpoints.

Detection hints:

- Enumerate views that modify state; ensure they validate ownership/permission.
- Look for use of only `is_authenticated` or only `is_staff` without checking
  object-level access.

Fix:

- Add explicit permission checks and tests for unauthorized access.

---

### DJANGO-ADMIN-001: Django admin must be treated as a high-value target

Severity: High

Required:

- MUST ensure admin is protected by strong authentication and HTTPS-only
  transport (see DJANGO-HTTPS-001). ([Django Project][1])
- SHOULD restrict admin exposure (network allowlists, VPN, SSO, or additional
  authentication controls) when possible.
- SHOULD audit installed admin extensions and third-party apps for XSS/CSRF
  exposure.

Insecure patterns:

- Admin exposed to the internet with weak authentication.
- Admin served over HTTP.

Detection hints:

- Search `urlpatterns` for `admin.site.urls`.
- Check deployment config for IP allowlisting or auth gateways.

Fix:

- Add network controls and enforce HTTPS.

---

### DJANGO-LOG-001: Logging and error reporting must not leak secrets

Severity: Medium to High

Required:

- MUST NOT log secrets (including `SECRET_KEY`, session cookies, auth headers,
  password reset tokens).
- MUST configure production logging deliberately; Django’s deployment checklist
  explicitly calls out reviewing logging before production.
  ([Django Project][1])
- MUST ensure `DEBUG=False` in production so exceptions aren’t rendered with
  sensitive context. ([Django Project][1])

Insecure patterns:

- Logging full request headers or cookies in production.
- Printing settings dictionaries.
- Debug error pages.

Detection hints:

- Inspect `LOGGING` config; search for middleware that logs request
  headers/cookies.
- Grep for `print(settings` / `logging.info(request.META)` patterns.

Fix:

- Redact sensitive values; log IDs not secrets.
- Use structured logging and a safe error monitoring tool. ([Django Project][1])

---

### DJANGO-SUPPLY-001: Dependency and patch hygiene (Django + security-critical deps)

Severity: Medium (High if known vulnerable versions)

Required:

- SHOULD pin and regularly update Django and security-critical dependencies.
- MUST respond to Django security releases promptly.

Detection hints:

- Check `requirements.txt`, lockfiles, build images.
- Identify Django version; compare against latest supported release (Django’s
  download page publishes current stable and supported branches).
  ([Django Project][9])

Fix:

- Upgrade to patched versions; add regression tests for previously vulnerable
  classes.

---

## 5) Practical scanning heuristics (how to “hunt”)

When actively scanning, use these high-signal patterns:

- Deployment/dev server:

  - `manage.py runserver`, `runserver 0.0.0.0`, `--insecure`
    ([Django Project][1])
- Debug / settings:

  - `DEBUG = True` ([Django Project][1])
  - `SECRET_KEY =`, `SECRET_KEY_FALLBACKS` ([Django Project][1])
- Host validation:

  - `ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['*']` ([Django Project][3])
- HTTPS and proxy:

  - `SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT`, `SECURE_HSTS_SECONDS`, `SECURE_PROXY_SSL_HEADER`
    ([Django Project][3])
- Cookies / sessions:

  - `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE`, `SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY`,
    `SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE` ([Django Project][3])
  - `CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE`, `CSRF_COOKIE_HTTPONLY`, `CSRF_COOKIE_SAMESITE`
    ([Django Project][3])
- CSRF bypasses:

  - `csrf_exempt`, missing `CsrfViewMiddleware`, POST forms without
    `{% csrf_token %}` ([Django Project][4])
- XSS:

  - `|safe`, `autoescape off`, `mark_safe(`, HTML string concatenation
    ([Django Project][5])
- SQL injection:

  - `.raw(`, `.extra(`, `RawSQL(`, `cursor.execute(` with formatted SQL strings
    ([Django Project][7])
- User uploads / media:

  - `request.FILES`, `MEDIA_ROOT`, `MEDIA_URL`, serving media inline;
    `MEDIA_ROOT == STATIC_ROOT` ([Django Project][1])
- Redirects:

  - `redirect(request.GET.get("next"))` patterns; missing allowlist validation
- Security headers and CSP:

  - Missing `SecurityMiddleware`, missing X-Frame-Options protection, missing
    `SECURE_CSP` adoption (where appropriate) ([Django Project][2])

Always try to confirm:

- data origin (untrusted vs trusted)
- sink type (template/SQL/subprocess/files/redirect/http)
- protective controls present (middleware, validation, allowlists, authz checks)
- whether security headers/controls are set in-app vs at the edge
