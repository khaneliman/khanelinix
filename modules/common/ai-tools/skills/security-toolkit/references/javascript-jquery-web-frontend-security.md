# jQuery Frontend Security Spec (jQuery 4.0.x, modern browsers)

This document is designed as a **security spec** that supports:

1. **Secure-by-default code generation** for new jQuery-based frontend code.
2. **Security review / vulnerability hunting** in existing jQuery-based code
   (passive “notice issues while working” and active “scan the repo and report
   findings”).

It is intentionally written as a set of **normative requirements**
(“MUST/SHOULD/MAY”) plus **audit rules** (what bad patterns look like, how to
detect them, and how to fix/mitigate them).

---

## 0) Safety, boundaries, and anti-abuse constraints (MUST FOLLOW)

- MUST NOT request, output, log, or commit secrets (API keys, passwords, private
  keys, session tokens, refresh tokens, CSRF tokens, session cookies).
- MUST treat the browser as an attacker-controlled environment:

  - Frontend checks (UI gating, “disable button”, hidden fields, client-side
    validation) MUST NOT be treated as authorization or a security boundary.
  - Server-side authorization and validation MUST exist even if frontend is
    “correct”.
- MUST NOT “fix” security by disabling protections (e.g., relaxing CSP to allow
  `unsafe-inline`, enabling JSONP “because it works”, adding broad CORS,
  disabling sanitization, suppressing security checks).
- MUST provide evidence-based findings during audits: cite file paths, code
  snippets, and relevant configuration values.
- MUST treat uncertainty honestly: if a protection might exist at the edge
  (CDN/WAF/reverse proxy headers like CSP), report it as “not visible in repo;
  verify at runtime/config”.

---

## 1) Operating modes

### 1.1 Generation mode (default)

When asked to write new jQuery code or modify existing jQuery code:

- MUST follow every **MUST** requirement in this spec.
- SHOULD follow every **SHOULD** requirement unless the user explicitly says
  otherwise.
- MUST prefer safe-by-default patterns: text insertion, DOM node construction,
  allowlists, and proven sanitization libraries over custom escaping.
- MUST avoid introducing new risky sinks (HTML string building, dynamic script
  loading, JSONP, inline script/event-handler attributes, unsafe URL assignment,
  unsafe object merging).

### 1.2 Passive review mode (always on while editing)

While working anywhere in a repo that uses jQuery (even if the user did not ask
for a security scan):

- MUST “notice” violations of this spec in touched/nearby code.
- SHOULD mention issues as they come up, with a brief explanation + safe fix.

### 1.3 Active audit mode (explicit scan request)

When the user asks to “scan”, “audit”, or “hunt for vulns”:

- MUST systematically search the codebase for violations of this spec.
- MUST output findings in the structured format (see §2.3).

Recommended audit order:

1. jQuery sourcing, versions, and dependency hygiene (script tags, lockfiles,
   CDN usage, SRI).
2. CSP / Trusted Types / security headers posture (in repo and at runtime if
   observable).
3. DOM XSS: untrusted sources → jQuery sinks (`.html`, `.append`, `$("<…>")`,
   `.load`, etc.).
4. Script execution sinks: JSONP, `dataType:"script"`, `$.getScript`, dynamic
   `<script>` insertion.
5. URL/attribute assignment (`href`, `src`, `style`, `on*` attributes).
6. Prototype pollution / unsafe object merging (`$.extend` patterns).
7. AJAX auth patterns + CSRF for cookie-based sessions.
8. Third-party plugins and untrusted content rendering paths (comments, WYSIWYG,
   markdown-to-HTML).

---

## 2) Definitions and review guidance

### 2.1 Untrusted input (treat as attacker-controlled unless proven otherwise)

Examples include:

- Any data from the server that originates from users (user profiles, comments,
  “display name”, rich text, filenames).
- Data from third-party APIs or services.
- Browser-controlled sources:

  - `location.href`, `location.search`, `location.hash`
  - `document.URL`, `document.baseURI`, `document.referrer`
  - `window.name`
  - `localStorage` / `sessionStorage`
  - `postMessage` event data (unless strict origin and schema validation exists)
  - Any DOM content that could have been injected previously (stored XSS)

### 2.2 High-risk “sinks” in jQuery contexts

A sink is a code path where untrusted input can become interpreted as executable
code or HTML.

Key jQuery sink categories:

- HTML insertion / parsing:

  - DOM manipulation methods that accept HTML strings such as `.html()`,
    `.append()`, and related methods (see CVE notes below). ([NVD][1])
  - `$(htmlString)` (when the argument can be interpreted as HTML markup).
  - `jQuery.parseHTML(html, …, keepScripts)` especially with `keepScripts=true`.
    ([jQuery API][2])
  - `.load(url)` (loads HTML into DOM; has special script execution behavior).
    ([jQuery API][3])
- Script execution / dynamic code loading:

  - `$.getScript()` / `$.ajax({ dataType: "script" })` (executes fetched
    JavaScript). ([jQuery API][4])
  - JSONP (`dataType: "jsonp"` or implicit JSONP behavior) (executes remote
    JavaScript as a response). ([jQuery API][5])
  - `eval`, `new Function`, `setTimeout("…")`, `setInterval("…")`,
    `$.globalEval` (if present)
- Dangerous attribute assignment:

  - Assigning untrusted strings to `href`, `src`, `srcdoc`, `style`, or
    event-handler attributes (`onload`, `onclick`, etc.)
  - `javascript:` URLs are particularly dangerous and discouraged.
    ([MDN Web Docs][6])

### 2.3 Required audit finding format

For each issue found, output:

- Rule ID:
- Severity: Critical / High / Medium / Low
- Location: file path + function/component + line(s)
- Evidence: the exact code/config snippet
- Impact: what could go wrong, who can exploit it
- Fix: safe change (prefer minimal diff)
- Mitigation: defense-in-depth if immediate fix is hard
- False positive notes: what to verify if uncertain

---

## 3) Secure baseline: minimum production configuration (MUST in production)

This is the smallest “production baseline” that prevents common jQuery-related
security failures.

### 3.1 Use a supported, patched jQuery version (MUST)

- MUST use a supported jQuery major version and keep it updated.
- As of 2026-01-27, the jQuery project ships jQuery 4.0.0 as the latest major
  release. ([blog.jquery.com][7])
- If you must support very old browsers (notably IE < 11), jQuery 4 does not
  support them and you may need to stay on jQuery 3.x; treat this as a higher
  risk posture and patch aggressively. ([blog.jquery.com][7])

### 3.2 Load jQuery safely (MUST)

- MUST load jQuery only from:

  - Your own build pipeline (bundled via npm/yarn + lockfile), or
  - The official jQuery CDN / a trusted CDN with Subresource Integrity (SRI)
    enabled.
- If loading from a CDN, SHOULD use SRI (`integrity`) and correct `crossorigin`
  settings; the jQuery project explicitly supports and recommends SRI on its
  CDN. (Retrieved from [jquery.com][8])

### 3.3 CSP + Trusted Types (SHOULD, and MUST where available/required by policy)

- SHOULD deploy a Content Security Policy (CSP) that reduces XSS impact
  (especially `script-src` restrictions and avoiding `unsafe-inline`). If not
  done through HTTP server, this can be done through the
  `<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="...">` tag.
  ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][9]) NOTE: It is most important to set the CSP's
  script-src. All other directives are not as important and can generally be
  excluded for the ease of development.
- SHOULD consider Trusted Types as a strong defense-in-depth against DOM XSS.
  ([W3C][10])
- If you deploy the CSP directive `require-trusted-types-for`, then code MUST
  route DOM-injection through Trusted Types policies. ([MDN Web Docs][11])
- Note: jQuery 4.0 explicitly added Trusted Types support so that TrustedHTML
  can be used with jQuery manipulation methods without violating
  `require-trusted-types-for`. ([blog.jquery.com][7])

### 3.4 Security headers and cookie posture (defense in depth; SHOULD)

Even though these are typically set server-side, they materially reduce the
blast radius of jQuery-related mistakes. However if the context is only the
frontend web application, these cannot be acted on.

- SHOULD set common security headers (CSP, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`,
  clickjacking protection via `frame-ancestors` / `X-Frame-Options`,
  `Referrer-Policy`). ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][12])
- SHOULD avoid storing long-lived secrets/tokens in places accessible to
  JavaScript (like `localStorage`) unless the threat model explicitly accepts
  “XSS == account takeover”. This is not jQuery-specific, but jQuery-heavy DOM
  manipulation increases the chance of DOM XSS regressions; reduce the payoff.

---

## 4) Rules (generation + audit)

Each rule contains: required practice, insecure patterns, detection hints, and
remediation.

### JQ-SUPPLY-001: jQuery MUST be patched; do not run known vulnerable versions

Severity: Medium (High if internet-facing app AND version is known-vulnerable)

NOTE: Before performing an upgrade, get consent from the user and try to
understand if they have reasons to keep it back. Upgrading can break
applications in unexpected ways. Report and recommend upgrades rather than just
performing them.

Required:

- MUST NOT use jQuery versions with known high-impact vulnerabilities when a
  patched version exists.
- MUST upgrade past:

  - CVE-2019-11358 (prototype pollution in jQuery before 3.4.0). ([NVD][13])
  - CVE-2020-11022 / CVE-2020-11023 (XSS risks in DOM manipulation methods when
    handling untrusted HTML; patched in 3.5.0). ([NVD][1])

Insecure patterns:

- Script tags or package manifests referencing old jQuery (e.g., `jquery-1.*`,
  `jquery-2.*`, `jquery-3.3.*`, `jquery-3.4.*`, `jquery-3.4.1`, etc.).
- Bundled vendor directories containing old minified jQuery without an upgrade
  path.

Detection hints:

- Search HTML/templates for `jquery-` and parse version strings.
- Check `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`.
- Check `vendor/`, `public/`, `static/`, `assets/`, `wwwroot/` for `jquery*.js`.

Fix:

- Upgrade to current jQuery (prefer latest stable major; as of 2026-01-27, 4.0.0
  is current). ([blog.jquery.com][7])
- If upgrade is constrained, at minimum upgrade beyond the CVE thresholds and
  add compensating controls (strong CSP, strict sanitization, remove risky APIs
  like JSONP, remove deep-extend of untrusted objects).

Notes:

- If a product requirement forces old versions, report as “accepted risk
  requiring compensating controls”.

---

### JQ-SUPPLY-002: Third-party script loading SHOULD use integrity and trusted origins

Severity: High

Required:

- MUST load jQuery and plugins only from trusted origins.
- If loaded from CDN, SHOULD use SRI (`integrity`) and correct `crossorigin`
  handling. ([jquery.com][8])

Insecure patterns:

- `<script src="https://…/jquery.min.js"></script>` with no `integrity`.
- Loading jQuery from random third-party CDNs without an explicit trust
  decision.

Detection hints:

- Scan HTML for `<script src=` and check for `integrity=` + `crossorigin=`.
- Identify dynamic script insertion with untrusted URLs (see JQ-EXEC-001).

Fix:

- Prefer bundling via npm + lockfile.
- If using CDN, copy official script tag (jQuery CDN supports SRI).
  ([jquery.com][8])

Note: If unable to get the correct SRI tag, skip this step but tell the user. If
you end up using the wrong one the app will not function. In that case remove it
and inform the user.

---

### JQ-XSS-001: Untrusted data MUST NOT be inserted as HTML via jQuery DOM-manipulation methods

Severity: High (if attacker-controlled content reaches these sinks)

Required:

- MUST treat any HTML string insertion as a code execution boundary.
- MUST use safe alternatives for untrusted text:

  - `.text(untrusted)` (text, not HTML). ([jQuery API][14])
  - `.val(untrusted)` for form fields. ([jQuery API][15])
  - Create elements and set text/attributes safely instead of concatenating HTML
    strings.

Insecure patterns (examples):

- `$(selector).html(untrusted)`
- `$(selector).append(untrusted)`
- `$(selector).before(untrusted)` / `.after(untrusted)` /
  `.replaceWith(untrusted)` / `.wrap(untrusted)` (and similar)
- Building markup: `"<div>" + untrusted + "</div>"` then passing to jQuery

Detection hints:

- Grep for: `.html(`, `.append(`, `.prepend(`, `.before(`, `.after(`,
  `.replaceWith(`, `.wrap(`, `.wrapAll(`, `.wrapInner(`
- Trace dataflow into these calls from sources in §2.1.

Fix:

- Replace with `.text()` / `.val()` or node construction:

  - `const $el = $("<span>").text(untrusted); container.append($el);`
- If the output must contain limited markup, see JQ-XSS-002 (sanitization).

Notes:

- Older jQuery versions had additional edge cases even when attempting
  sanitization; patched in 3.5.0+. Still: never rely on “string sanitization”
  alone—prefer structured creation or proven sanitizers. ([GitHub][16])

---

### JQ-XSS-002: If rendering user-controlled HTML is required, it MUST be sanitized with a proven HTML sanitizer

Severity: Medium (High if rich HTML is attacker-controlled and sanitizer is
weak/misconfigured)

Required:

- MUST NOT “roll your own” HTML sanitizer with regexes.
- If user-controlled HTML must be displayed (e.g., rich text comments), MUST
  sanitize using a well-maintained HTML sanitizer and a restrictive allowlist.

  - DOMPurify is a common choice; use conservative configuration and keep it
    updated. ([GitHub][17])
  - Where available, MAY consider the browser HTML Sanitizer API (note: limited
    browser availability). ([MDN Web Docs][18])
- SHOULD pair sanitization with CSP and, where feasible, Trusted Types for
  defense in depth. ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][9])

Insecure patterns:

- Regex-based “strip `<script>`” or “escape `<`” attempts followed by `.html()`
  insertion.
- DOMPurify (or similar) configured to allow overly broad tags/attributes, or
  configuration that’s not reviewed.

Detection hints:

- Search for “sanitize” helper functions, regex replacing `<`/`>` patterns, or
  “allow all tags” configs.
- Identify features that render user-generated “rich text” or “custom HTML”.
- Check if sanitizer results are inserted with `.html()` or equivalent sinks.

Fix:

- Introduce a sanitizer with strict allowlist.
- Centralize the “sanitize then inject” pattern into a single reviewed module.
- Add regression tests covering representative malicious inputs (don’t store
  payloads in logs or telemetry).

False positive notes:

- If content is guaranteed trusted (e.g., compiled templates shipped by you),
  document the trust boundary and why it is not attacker-controlled.

---

### JQ-XSS-003: `$(untrustedString)` and `jQuery.parseHTML` MUST NOT process attacker-controlled markup

Severity: High (if attacker-controlled)

Required:

- MUST NOT pass attacker-controlled strings to `$()` when they might be
  interpreted as HTML.
- MUST treat `jQuery.parseHTML(html, …, keepScripts)` as a high-risk primitive;
  keepScripts MUST be `false` for any untrusted input. ([jQuery API][2])

Insecure patterns:

- `const $node = $(untrusted);`
- `$.parseHTML(untrusted, /* context */, true)` (scripts preserved)

Detection hints:

- Search for `$(` calls where the argument is not a static selector or static
  markup.
- Search for `$.parseHTML(` and inspect the `keepScripts` argument.

Fix:

- Use DOM creation with constant tag names and `.text()` for untrusted values.
- If parsing HTML is necessary, sanitize first (JQ-XSS-002) and keep scripts
  disabled.

---

### JQ-XSS-004: `.load()` MUST be treated as an HTML+script injection surface

Severity: Medium (High if URL/content is attacker-controlled)

Required:

- MUST NOT use `.load()` with attacker-controlled URLs or attacker-controlled
  HTML fragments.
- MUST understand jQuery `.load()` script behavior:

  - Without a selector in the URL, content is passed to `.html()` before scripts
    are removed, which can execute scripts. ([jQuery API][3])
- SHOULD prefer `fetch()`/XHR to retrieve data, then render with safe DOM
  creation or sanitize explicitly.

Insecure patterns:

- `$("#target").load(untrustedUrl)`
- `$("#target").load("/path?param=" + untrusted)`

Detection hints:

- Search for `.load(` across JS/TS files.
- Identify whether a selector is appended to the URL (the behavior differs).
  ([jQuery API][3])
- Trace whether the URL can be influenced by user input.

Fix:

- Replace `.load()` with:

  - `fetch()` to retrieve JSON, then render via `.text()` / node construction,
    or
  - `fetch()` to retrieve HTML, sanitize it, then inject.
- If `.load()` must remain, ensure the URL is constant or strictly allowlisted
  and the returned content is trusted.

---

### JQ-EXEC-001: Dynamic script execution and script fetching MUST NOT be reachable from untrusted input

Severity: High

Required:

- MUST NOT fetch-and-execute scripts from untrusted or user-influenced URLs.
- MUST treat these as code execution primitives:

  - `$.getScript(url)` executes the fetched script in the global context.
    ([jQuery API][4])
  - `$.ajax({ dataType: "script" })` and other script-typed requests that
    execute responses.
- SHOULD remove these patterns unless there is a strong, reviewed justification.

Insecure patterns:

- `$.getScript(untrustedUrl)`
- `$.ajax({ url: untrustedUrl, dataType: "script" })`
- Dynamic `<script src=...>` injection where `src` is derived from untrusted
  input.

Detection hints:

- Search for `getScript(`, `dataType: "script"`, `globalEval`, `eval`,
  `new Function`.
- Look for “plugin loader” or “theme loader” features that accept URLs.

Fix:

- Bundle scripts at build time.
- If runtime-loading is required, restrict to allowlisted, versioned,
  integrity-checked assets (and ideally still avoid runtime code loading).

---

### JQ-AJAX-001: JSONP MUST be disabled unless the endpoint is fully trusted (and even then, avoid)

Severity: Medium (High if attacker can influence URL/endpoint)

Required:

- MUST NOT use JSONP for untrusted endpoints because it executes JavaScript
  responses.
- When using `$.ajax`, MUST explicitly disable JSONP for non-fully-trusted
  targets; jQuery’s own docs recommend setting `jsonp: false` “for security
  reasons” if you don’t trust the target. ([jQuery API][5])
- SHOULD prefer CORS with JSON (`dataType: "json"`) and explicit origin
  allowlists server-side.

Insecure patterns:

- `dataType: "jsonp"`
- URLs containing `callback=?` or patterns that trigger JSONP behavior. callback
  arguments are historically XSS vectors.
- `$.get(untrustedUrl)` without pinning `dataType` and disabling JSONP (risk
  depends on options and jQuery behavior)

Detection hints:

- Search for `jsonp`, `dataType: "jsonp"`, `callback=?`.
- Search for cross-domain AJAX where the URL is not hard-coded or allowlisted.

Fix:

- Use JSON over HTTPS with CORS configured server-side.
- Set:

  - `dataType: "json"`
  - `jsonp: false` (defense in depth when URL might be ambiguous)
    ([jQuery API][5])

---

### JQ-AJAX-002: State-changing AJAX requests using cookie auth MUST be CSRF-protected

Severity: High

NOTE: This only matters when using cookie based auth. If the request use
Authorization header, there is no CSRF potential.

Required:

- If authentication uses cookies, MUST protect state-changing requests
  (POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE) against CSRF.
- SHOULD use server-verified CSRF tokens; for AJAX calls, tokens are commonly
  sent in a custom header. ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][19])
- MUST NOT treat “it’s an AJAX request” as CSRF protection by itself.

Insecure patterns:

- `$.post("/transfer", {...})` or `$.ajax({ method: "POST", ... })` with cookie
  auth and no CSRF token/header.
- “CSRF protection” that only checks for `X-Requested-With` (defense-in-depth
  only, not primary).

Detection hints:

- Enumerate state-changing AJAX calls and locate whether they include CSRF
  tokens.
- Identify how the server expects CSRF validation (meta tag, cookie-to-header
  double submit, synchronizer token, etc.).

Fix:

- Add CSRF token inclusion in a centralized place, e.g.,
  `$.ajaxSetup({ headers: { "X-CSRF-Token": token } })`, and ensure server
  verifies.
- Follow OWASP CSRF guidance for token properties and validation.
  ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][19])

False positive notes:

- If auth is not cookie-based (e.g., Authorization header bearer token) CSRF
  risk is different; verify actual auth mechanism.

---

### JQ-ATTR-001: Untrusted values MUST NOT be written into dangerous attributes without validation/allowlisting

Severity: Low (High for events like onclick)

Required:

- MUST validate/allowlist URLs written into `href`, `src`, `action`, etc.
- MUST block dangerous schemes; `javascript:` URLs are discouraged because they
  can execute code. ([MDN Web Docs][6])
- MUST NOT set event-handler attributes (`onclick`, `onerror`, etc.) from
  strings.
- SHOULD avoid writing untrusted strings into `style` attributes; prefer
  toggling predefined CSS classes.

Insecure patterns:

- `$("a").attr("href", untrustedUrl)`
- `$("img").attr("src", untrustedUrl)`
- `$(el).attr("style", untrustedCss)`
- `$(el).attr("onclick", untrustedJs)`

Detection hints:

- Search for `.attr("href"`, `.attr("src"`, `.attr("style"`, `.prop("href"`,
  `.prop("src"`.
- Trace whether inputs come from URL params, server JSON, DOM, or storage.

Fix:

- Parse and validate URLs with `new URL(value, location.origin)` and allowlist
  protocols (`https:` etc.) and hostnames when needed.
- For navigation targets, prefer relative paths you construct rather than full
  URLs.
- Replace `style` strings with `addClass/removeClass` using predefined class
  names.

---

### JQ-SELECTOR-001: User-controlled selector fragments MUST be escaped with `jQuery.escapeSelector`

Severity: Medium (can become High if it enables wrong-element selection in
security-relevant UI)

Required:

- If you must select by an ID/class that can contain special CSS characters,
  SHOULD use `jQuery.escapeSelector()` (available in jQuery 3.0+).
  ([jQuery API][20])
- MUST NOT concatenate raw attacker-controlled strings into selector
  expressions.

Insecure patterns:

- `$("#" + untrustedId)`
- `$("[data-id='" + untrusted + "']")` (especially without strict
  quoting/escaping)

Detection hints:

- Search for `"#" +`, `". " +`, or template strings used inside `$(` selectors.
- Look for “select by user-supplied id”.

Fix:

- `$("#" + $.escapeSelector(untrustedId))` ([jQuery API][20])
- Prefer stable internal IDs over user-derived selectors.

Notes:

- This is often “robustness”, but it can become security-relevant if incorrect
  selection causes UI to reveal/modify the wrong data or skip security-related
  prompts.

---

### JQ-PROTOTYPE-001: Do not deep-merge untrusted objects; prevent prototype pollution

Severity: Medium

Required:

- MUST NOT deep-merge (`$.extend(true, …)`) attacker-controlled objects into
  application objects without filtering dangerous keys.
- MUST ensure jQuery is >= 3.4.0 to avoid CVE-2019-11358 prototype pollution
  behavior. ([NVD][13])

Insecure patterns:

- `$.extend(true, target, untrustedObj)`
- `$.extend(true, {}, defaults, untrustedObj)` where untrustedObj comes from
  URL/JSON/storage

Detection hints:

- Search for `$.extend(true` and inspect sources of merged objects.
- Search for “merge options” / “apply config” patterns using untrusted JSON.

Fix:

- Prefer:

  - Shallow merges with an allowlisted set of keys, or
  - A safe merge helper that explicitly rejects `__proto__`, `prototype`,
    `constructor`, and nested occurrences.
- Keep jQuery patched.

---

### JQ-CSP-001: CSP and Trusted Types SHOULD be used to make DOM XSS harder to introduce and exploit

Severity: Medium

Required:

- SHOULD deploy CSP as defense-in-depth against XSS.
  ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][9])
- If enabling Trusted Types (`require-trusted-types-for`), MUST ensure DOM
  injection goes through Trusted Types policies. ([MDN Web Docs][11])
- When using jQuery 4, SHOULD take advantage of its Trusted Types support
  (TrustedHTML inputs). ([blog.jquery.com][7])

Insecure patterns:

- “Fixing” a jQuery feature by weakening CSP (`script-src 'unsafe-inline'` /
  `'unsafe-eval'`) without a compensating plan.
- No CSP on applications that render user content or manipulate DOM heavily.

Detection hints:

- Look for CSP headers (server configs, framework middleware, meta tags).
- If not visible in repo, flag as “verify at edge/runtime”.

Fix:

- Add CSP incrementally; start by eliminating inline scripts and inline event
  handlers, then tighten `script-src`.
- Add Trusted Types where supported and feasible.

---

## 5) Practical scanning heuristics (how to “hunt”)

When actively scanning, use these high-signal patterns:

- jQuery version / sourcing:

  - `jquery-*.js` in `vendor/` or `static/`
  - `package.json` dependency `jquery` pinned to old versions
  - CDN script tags lacking `integrity`/`crossorigin` ([jquery.com][8])
- HTML injection sinks (DOM XSS):

  - `.html(`, `.append(`, `.prepend(`, `.before(`, `.after(`, `.replaceWith(`,
    `.wrap(`
  - `$(` where argument might be HTML / template strings
  - `$.parseHTML(` especially with `keepScripts=true` ([jQuery API][2])
  - `.load(` (and whether selector is appended; script behavior differs)
    ([jQuery API][3])
- Script execution / dynamic code:

  - `$.getScript(`, `dataType: "script"` ([jQuery API][4])
  - `dataType: "jsonp"` or `jsonp:` usage; `callback=?` patterns
    ([jQuery API][5])
  - `eval`, `new Function`, `setTimeout("…")`, `$.globalEval`
- Dangerous attribute writes:

  - `.attr("href", …)`, `.attr("src", …)`, `.attr("style", …)`
  - Any assignment of `javascript:`-like schemes or suspicious URL construction
    ([MDN Web Docs][6])
- Selector construction:

  - `$("#" + user)` and similar; fix via `$.escapeSelector` ([jQuery API][20])
- Prototype pollution:

  - `$.extend(true, …, userObj)`; ensure jQuery >= 3.4.0 and filter dangerous
    keys ([NVD][13])
- CSRF posture for AJAX:

  - `$.post(` / `$.ajax({ method: ... })` with cookies and no CSRF token/header
    ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][19])
- Defense-in-depth:

  - Absence of CSP/security headers in configs (or not visible; require runtime
    verification) ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][12])

Always try to confirm:

- data origin (untrusted vs trusted)
- sink type (HTML insertion / script execution / attribute / selector / object
  merge)
- protective controls present (sanitizer, allowlists, CSP, Trusted Types, CSRF
  validation)
