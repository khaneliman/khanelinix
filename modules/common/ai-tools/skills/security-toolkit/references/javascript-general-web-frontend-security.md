# Frontend JavaScript/TypeScript Web Security Spec (Vanilla Browser JS/TS, Modern Browsers)

This document is designed as a **security spec** that supports:

1. **Secure-by-default code generation** for new frontend JavaScript/TypeScript
   (no specific framework assumed).
2. **Security review / vulnerability hunting** in existing frontend code
   (passive “notice issues while working” and active “scan the repo and report
   findings”).

It is intentionally written as a set of **normative requirements**
(“MUST/SHOULD/MAY”) plus **audit rules** (what bad patterns look like, how to
detect them, and how to fix/mitigate them).

---

## 0) Safety, boundaries, and anti-abuse constraints (MUST FOLLOW)

- MUST NOT request, output, log, hard-code, or commit secrets (API keys intended
  to be secret, private keys, passwords, OAuth refresh tokens, session tokens,
  cookies). Notes:

  - Frontend code is inherently observable by end users. If a value must remain
    secret, it must not be in browser-delivered code.
  - If the project uses “public” keys (e.g., publishable analytics keys), they
    MUST be treated as non-secret and scoped accordingly.

- MUST NOT “fix” security by disabling protections (e.g., weakening CSP with
  `unsafe-inline`/`unsafe-eval` without justification, removing origin checks
  for `postMessage`, switching to `innerHTML` for convenience, accepting
  arbitrary redirects/URLs, or turning off sanitization).

- MUST provide **evidence-based findings** during audits: cite file paths, code
  snippets, and relevant HTML/CSP/config values that justify the claim.

- MUST treat uncertainty honestly:

  - Security headers (CSP, frame-ancestors, etc.) might be set by
    server/edge/CDN rather than in repo code. If not visible, report as “not
    visible here; verify at runtime/edge config.” (Also note that
    `<meta http-equiv=...>` only simulates a subset of headers; don’t assume
    other security headers exist just because a meta tag exists.)
    ([MDN Web Docs][1])

---

## 1) Operating modes

### 1.1 Generation mode (default)

When asked to write new frontend JS/TS code or modify existing code:

- MUST follow every **MUST** requirement in this spec.
- SHOULD follow every **SHOULD** requirement unless the user explicitly says
  otherwise.
- MUST prefer safe-by-default browser APIs and proven libraries over custom
  security code (especially for HTML sanitization).
- MUST avoid introducing new risky sinks (DOM XSS injection sinks like
  `innerHTML`, navigation to `javascript:` URLs, dynamic code execution via
  `eval`/`Function`, unsafe `postMessage`, unsafe third-party script loading,
  etc.). ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][2])

### 1.2 Passive review mode (always on while editing)

While working anywhere in a frontend repo (even if the user did not ask for a
security scan):

- MUST “notice” violations of this spec in touched/nearby code.
- SHOULD mention issues as they come up, with a brief explanation + safe fix.

### 1.3 Active audit mode (explicit scan request)

When the user asks to “scan”, “audit”, or “hunt for vulns”:

- MUST systematically search the codebase for violations of this spec.
- MUST output findings in a structured format (see §2.3).

Recommended audit order:

1. HTML entrypoints (`index.html`, server-rendered templates), script/style
   includes, and any CSP delivery (header vs meta). ([W3C][3])
2. DOM XSS sinks (`innerHTML`, `document.write`, `insertAdjacentHTML`,
   event-handler attributes) and their data sources (URL params/hash, storage,
   postMessage, API responses). ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][2])
3. Navigation/redirect handling (`window.location*`, link targets, URL
   allowlists) including `javascript:` URL hazards. ([MDN Web Docs][4])
4. Cross-origin communication (`postMessage`, iframe embed patterns,
   sandboxing). ([MDN Web Docs][5])
5. Storage of sensitive data (localStorage/sessionStorage) and assumptions about
   trust. ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][6])
6. Third-party scripts / tag managers / CDNs, and integrity controls (SRI) and
   policy controls (CSP). ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][7])
7. DOM clobbering gadgets and unsafe reliance on `window`/`document` named
   properties. ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][8])

---

## 2) Definitions and review guidance

### 2.1 Untrusted input (treat as attacker-controlled unless proven otherwise)

Examples include:

- URL-derived data: `location.href`, `location.search`, `location.hash`,
  `document.baseURI`, `new URLSearchParams(location.search)`, routing fragments.
  ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][2])
- DOM content that may include user-controlled markup (comments, profiles, CMS
  content, markdown-to-HTML output, etc.), especially if inserted dynamically.
  ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][2])
- `postMessage` event data (`event.data`) and metadata (`event.origin`) from
  other windows/frames. ([MDN Web Docs][5])
- Browser storage: `localStorage`, `sessionStorage`, IndexedDB (contents can be
  attacker-influenced via XSS or local machine access; never treat as
  “trusted”). ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][6])
- Any data returned from network calls (even if from “your API”), because it may
  contain stored attacker content that becomes dangerous only when inserted into
  the DOM. ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][2])

### 2.2 Dangerous sink (DOM XSS / code execution sink)

A sink is any API/operation that can execute script or interpret
attacker-controlled strings as HTML/JS/URL in a security-sensitive way.
High-signal sinks include:

- HTML parsing / insertion: `innerHTML`, `outerHTML`, `insertAdjacentHTML`,
  `document.write`, `document.writeln`. ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][2])
- Dynamic code execution: `eval`, `new Function`, `setTimeout("...")`,
  `setInterval("...")`. ([MDN Web Docs][10])
- Navigation to script-bearing URLs (e.g., `javascript:`) via setters like
  `Location.href`/`window.location` (and via link `href` if
  attacker-controlled). ([MDN Web Docs][4])
- Setting event handler attributes from strings, e.g.
  `setAttribute("onclick", "...")`. ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][2])

### 2.3 Required audit finding format

For each issue found, output:

- Rule ID:
- Severity: Critical / High / Medium / Low
- Location: file path + function/class/module + line(s)
- Evidence: the exact code/config snippet
- Impact: what could go wrong, who can exploit it
- Fix: safe change (prefer minimal diff)
- Mitigation: defense-in-depth if immediate fix is hard
- False positive notes: what to verify if uncertain

---

## 3) Secure baseline: minimum production configuration (MUST in production)

This is the smallest baseline that prevents common frontend JS/TS security
misconfigurations. Some items are “in repo” (HTML/JS) and some may live at the
server/edge.

### 3.1 Content Security Policy (CSP) baseline (SHOULD; MUST for high-risk apps)

- SHOULD deliver CSP via HTTP response headers when possible.
- MAY deliver CSP via an HTML `<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" ...>`
  tag when you cannot set headers (e.g., purely static hosting constraints).
  ([MDN Web Docs][1])
- If using CSP via `<meta http-equiv>`, MUST understand the limitations:

  - The policy only applies to content that follows the meta element (so it must
    appear very early, before any scripts/resources you want governed).
    ([W3C][3])
  - The following directives are **not supported** in a meta-delivered policy
    and will be ignored: `report-uri`, `frame-ancestors`, and `sandbox`.
    ([W3C][3])
  - “Report-only” CSP cannot be set via a meta element. ([W3C][3])

Practical baseline goals:

- Avoid script sources `unsafe-inline` and `unsafe-eval` (they significantly
  weaken CSP’s value against XSS). ([MDN Web Docs][10])
- Prefer nonce- or hash-based script policies if you need inline scripts.
  ([MDN Web Docs][10])
- Consider enabling Trusted Types enforcement where feasible.
  ([MDN Web Docs][11])

### 3.2 Third-party scripts baseline (SHOULD)

- SHOULD minimize third-party script execution and treat it as equivalent
  privilege to first-party JS (it runs with your origin’s privileges).
  ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][7])
- SHOULD use Subresource Integrity (SRI) for third-party scripts/styles loaded
  from CDNs. ([MDN Web Docs][12])

### 3.3 Cross-window communication baseline (SHOULD)

- SHOULD restrict `postMessage` communications to explicit origins, and validate
  both origin and message shape. ([MDN Web Docs][5])

---

## 4) Rules (generation + audit)

Each rule contains: required practice, insecure patterns, detection hints, and
remediation.

### JS-XSS-001: Do not inject untrusted HTML into the DOM (avoid `innerHTML` and friends)

Severity: Critical if you can prove attacker-controlled input can reach these
APIs; otherwise Medium

Required:

- MUST treat `innerHTML`, `outerHTML`, and `insertAdjacentHTML` as dangerous
  sinks when their input can contain untrusted data.
  ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][2])
- MUST prefer safe DOM APIs that do not parse HTML:

  - `textContent` for text. ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][2])
  - `document.createElement`, `appendChild`, `setAttribute` for
    non-event-handler attributes. ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][2])
- If HTML insertion is truly required, SHOULD sanitize with a well-reviewed HTML
  sanitizer and strongly consider enforcing Trusted Types to confine usage to
  audited code paths. ([MDN Web Docs][11])

Insecure patterns:

- `el.innerHTML = userInput`
- `el.insertAdjacentHTML('beforeend', userInput)`
- `el.outerHTML = userInput`

Detection hints:

- Search for: `.innerHTML`, `.outerHTML`, `insertAdjacentHTML(`.
- Trace the origin of inserted string: URL params/hash, postMessage, storage,
  API responses, DOM attributes. ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][2])

Fix:

- Replace with `textContent` for plain text. ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][2])
- For structured UI, build DOM nodes explicitly.
- For “rich text” requirements:

  - Sanitize using an allowlist-based sanitizer.
  - Prefer returning safe “components” instead of arbitrary HTML strings.
  - Use Trusted Types enforcement to ensure only `TrustedHTML` reaches sinks
    where supported. ([MDN Web Docs][11])

Mitigation:

- Deploy a strict CSP and consider Trusted Types enforcement
  (`require-trusted-types-for 'script'`). ([MDN Web Docs][10])

False positive notes:

- If the string is provably constant or fully generated from trusted constants,
  it may be safe. Still prefer safer APIs.

---

### JS-XSS-002: Avoid `document.write` / `document.writeln` (XSS + document clobbering hazards)

Severity: Critical if you can prove attacker-controlled input can reach these
APIs; otherwise Medium

Required:

- MUST avoid `document.write()` and `document.writeln()` in production code
  (they are XSS vectors and can be abused with crafted HTML even if some
  browsers block injected `<script>` in certain situations).
  ([MDN Web Docs][13])
- If legacy use is unavoidable, MUST ensure no untrusted input reaches these
  APIs and SHOULD enforce Trusted Types (`TrustedHTML`) where supported.
  ([MDN Web Docs][14])

Insecure patterns:

- `document.write(userInput)`
- `document.writeln(getParam('q'))`

Detection hints:

- Search for `document.write(`, `document.writeln(`.
  ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][2])

Fix:

- Replace with DOM manipulation (`createElement`, `appendChild`) or safe text
  insertion (`textContent`). ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][2])

Mitigation:

- Strict CSP + Trusted Types enforcement reduces blast radius if a sink remains.
  ([MDN Web Docs][10])

---

### JS-XSS-003: Do not use string-to-code execution (`eval`, `new Function`, string timeouts)

Severity: Critical if you can prove attacker-controlled input can reach these
APIs; otherwise Medium

Required:

- MUST NOT pass untrusted data to:

  - `eval()`
  - `new Function(...)`
  - `setTimeout("...")` / `setInterval("...")` with string arguments
    ([MDN Web Docs][10])
- SHOULD avoid these APIs entirely in modern frontend code; refactor to non-eval
  logic. ([MDN Web Docs][10])
- MUST NOT “fix CSP breakage” by adding `unsafe-eval` unless there is a
  documented, reviewed justification and compensating controls.
  ([MDN Web Docs][10])

Insecure patterns:

- `eval(userInput)`
- `new Function("return " + userInput)()`
- `setTimeout(userInput, 0)` where userInput is a string

Detection hints:

- Search for `eval(`, `new Function`, `setTimeout("`, `setInterval("`.
- Also search for construction of code strings used later.

Fix:

- Replace dynamic code with:

  - structured data + explicit branching/handlers,
  - JSON parsing (`JSON.parse`) instead of `eval` for JSON.
    ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][2])

Mitigation:

- CSP that blocks `eval()`-like APIs by default, and avoid `unsafe-eval`.
  ([MDN Web Docs][10])
- Consider Trusted Types for controlled cases, but treat it as a hardening
  layer, not a license to keep eval patterns. ([MDN Web Docs][10])

---

### JS-XSS-004: Do not set event handler attributes from strings (e.g., `setAttribute("onclick", "...")`)

Severity: High

Required:

- MUST NOT use `setAttribute("on…", string)` or similar patterns with untrusted
  data; this coerces strings into executable code in the event-handler context.
  ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][2])
- SHOULD prefer `addEventListener` with function references.

Insecure patterns:

- `el.setAttribute("onclick", userInput)`
- `el.onclick = userControlledString` (string assignment)

Detection hints:

- Search for `.setAttribute("on`, `.onclick =`, `.onmouseover =`, etc.
- Trace whether RHS can be influenced by URL/hash/storage/postMessage.
  ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][2])

Fix:

- Replace with `addEventListener("click", () => { ... })`.
- If dynamic dispatch is needed, use an allowlisted mapping from identifiers to
  functions (no string eval). ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][2])

---

### JS-URL-001: Sanitize and allowlist URLs before navigation (especially `window.location` / `location.replace`)

Severity: Low (High if you can prove an attacker can fully control the URL)

IMPORTANT: This can cause a lot of false positives. Please perform extra
analysis to determine if the url is fully attacker controlled. If not fully
attacker controlled, then this is informational at best.

NOTE: It may be important functionality to be able to redirect to any given url.
If that is the goal of the feature, then at a minimum, ensure it checks the
schema even if the origin is allowed to be anything.

Required:

- MUST treat any assignment to navigation targets as security-sensitive:

  - `window.location = ...`
  - `location.href = ...`
  - `location.assign(...)`
  - `location.replace(...)` ([MDN Web Docs][4])
- MUST prevent navigation to `javascript:` URLs (and generally other
  script-bearing/active schemes), especially when input is derived from URL
  params, storage, or messages. ([MDN Web Docs][4]). Only allow `http:` and
  `https:`.
- SHOULD validate/allowlist the destination. A safe baseline is:

  - Allow only same-origin relative paths, OR
  - Allow only a strict allowlist of origins and protocols (typically `https:`
    and optionally `http:` for localhost dev). ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][8])

Insecure patterns:

- `location.replace(getParam("next"))`
- `window.location = userSuppliedUrl`
- `location.assign(window.redirectTo || "/")` where `redirectTo` can be
  clobbered or attacker-set ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][8])

Detection hints:

- Search for `window.location`, `location.href`, `location.assign`,
  `location.replace`.
- Search for common redirect parameters: `next`, `returnTo`, `redirect`, `url`,
  `continue`.
- Search for `javascript:` literal usage. ([MDN Web Docs][4])

Fix:

- Parse and validate with `new URL(value, location.origin)` and then enforce:

  - `url.protocol` in `{ "https:" }` (and only include `http:` in explicit
    dev-only code paths),
  - `url.origin` equals `location.origin` for internal redirects, or in a strict
    allowlist for external redirects,
  - optionally allow only specific path prefixes. ([MDN Web Docs][4])
- If validation fails, navigate to a safe default (home/dashboard).

Mitigation:

- Deploy strict CSP and Trusted Types enforcement to reduce the impact of DOM
  XSS sinks, but note that Trusted Types do not prevent every possible unsafe
  navigation scenario on their own. ([W3C][15])

False positive notes:

IMPORTANT: This can cause a lot of false positives. Please perform extra
analysis to determine if the url is fully attacker controlled. If not fully
attacker controlled, then this is informational at best.

- Some apps intentionally support external redirects (SSO, payment flows). Those
  MUST be allowlisted and documented.

---

### JS-URL-002: Sanitize URLs before inserting into DOM URL contexts (`href`, `src`, etc.)

Severity: Low (High if you can prove an attacker can fully control the URL)

IMPORTANT: This can cause a lot of false positives. Please perform extra
analysis to determine if the url is fully attacker controlled. If not fully
attacker controlled, then this is informational at best.

Required:

- MUST treat setting URL-bearing DOM attributes/properties as
  security-sensitive, especially:

  - `a.href`, `img.src`, `script.src`, `iframe.src`, `form.action`, `link.href`.
- MUST prevent script-bearing schemes (`javascript:` and other active schemes)
  when values can be attacker-influenced. ([MDN Web Docs][4])
- SHOULD prefer setting properties (e.g., `a.href = url.toString()`) after
  parsing and validation, rather than string concatenation.

Insecure patterns:

- `link.href = getParam("u")`
- `el.setAttribute("href", userInput)` without validation
- constructing URLs via concatenation with untrusted pieces

Detection hints:

- Search for `.href =`, `.src =`, `.action =`, `setAttribute("href"`,
  `setAttribute("src"`.
- Search for `javascript:` / `data:` usage in URLs. ([MDN Web Docs][4])

IMPORTANT: This can cause a lot of false positives. Please perform extra
analysis to determine if the url is fully attacker controlled. If not fully
attacker controlled, then this is informational at best.

Fix:

- Use `new URL(...)` and validate:

  - protocol allowlist
  - avoid passing user-provided values into `<script src>` at all (treat as code
    execution). ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][8])

---

### JS-CSP-001: Use CSP; meta delivery is allowed

Severity: Medium to High (depends on threat model; High when handling untrusted
content)

NOTE: It is most important to set the CSP's script-src. All other directives are
not as important and can generally be excluded for the ease of development.

Required:

- SHOULD deploy a CSP as a major defense-in-depth against XSS.
  ([MDN Web Docs][10])
- MAY provide CSP via `<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" ...>` when
  headers are not available. ([MDN Web Docs][1])
- If CSP is delivered via meta, MUST:

  - place it early (before scripts/resources you want governed), and
  - not rely on unsupported directives in meta policies (`report-uri`,
    `frame-ancestors`, `sandbox`). ([W3C][3])
- MUST avoid adding `unsafe-inline` as a “quick fix” for CSP issues unless
  explicitly required and reviewed (it defeats much of CSP’s purpose).
  ([MDN Web Docs][10])
- MUST avoid adding `unsafe-eval` unless explicitly required and reviewed (it
  allows eval-like APIs that are commonly abused). ([MDN Web Docs][10])

Insecure patterns:

- No CSP present anywhere (repo HTML or server/edge) for an app that renders
  untrusted content.
- CSP includes `script-src 'unsafe-inline'` and/or `script-src 'unsafe-eval'`
  without strong justification. ([MDN Web Docs][10])
- CSP delivered via meta but includes `frame-ancestors` (it will be ignored in
  meta). ([W3C][3])

Detection hints:

- Search HTML for `<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy"`.
- Search server/edge configs for `Content-Security-Policy` header.
- If CSP is only in meta, check it appears before any `<script>` tags you want
  governed. ([W3C][3])

Fix:

- Prefer header-delivered CSP at the server/edge.
- If constrained to meta, keep a strong allowlist CSP and document the
  limitations; implement clickjacking protections (e.g., `frame-ancestors`) at
  the server/edge, not in meta. ([W3C][3])

---

### JS-CSP-002: Prefer strict CSP (nonces/hashes); avoid inline/eval patterns in code

Severity: Medium

NOTE: It is most important to set the CSP's script-src. All other directives are
not as important and can generally be excluded for the ease of development.

Required:

- SHOULD design frontend code to work under a strict CSP:

  - avoid inline scripts and inline event handlers,
  - avoid eval-like APIs (see JS-XSS-003),
  - allow scripts via nonce or hash when needed. ([MDN Web Docs][10])

Insecure patterns:

- Large amounts of inline script blocks and inline `onclick="..."` handlers.
- Libraries that require `unsafe-eval`.

Detection hints:

- Search for `<script>` blocks with inline code, `onclick="`, `onload="`, etc.
- Search for CSP directives containing `unsafe-inline` or `unsafe-eval`.
  ([MDN Web Docs][10])

Fix:

- Move inline scripts into external JS files (same-origin).
- Use nonces/hashes for any unavoidable inline blocks. ([MDN Web Docs][10])

---

### JS-TT-001: Use Trusted Types to reduce DOM XSS attack surface (where supported)

Severity: Low

Required:

- SHOULD consider enabling Trusted Types enforcement with CSP
  `require-trusted-types-for 'script'` to make many DOM XSS sinks reject raw
  strings. ([MDN Web Docs][11])
- If using Trusted Types, SHOULD also use the CSP `trusted-types` directive to
  restrict which policies can be created (reduces policy sprawl and improves
  auditability). ([MDN Web Docs][16])
- MUST keep Trusted Types policy code small, heavily reviewed, and used as the
  only path to produce trusted values for sinks. ([W3C][15])

Insecure patterns:

- “Trusted Types enabled” but policy simply returns input unchanged (no
  sanitization/validation).
- Many ad-hoc policies created across the codebase without restriction.
- Belief that Trusted Types alone prevents all unsafe navigations or all XSS
  classes. (It targets DOM injection sinks; it is not a universal sandbox.)
  ([W3C][15])

Detection hints:

- Search for CSP directives: `require-trusted-types-for` and `trusted-types`.
- Search code for `trustedTypes.createPolicy(` and inspect policy
  implementations. ([MDN Web Docs][11])

Fix:

- Add a small set of well-reviewed policies (e.g., `createHTML` that sanitizes).
- Restrict allowed policies via `trusted-types <policyName...>`.
- Migrate sinks to require `TrustedHTML` / `TrustedScriptURL` as appropriate.
  ([MDN Web Docs][11])

---

### JS-MSG-001: `postMessage` must use strict origin validation and explicit targetOrigin

Severity: Medium (High if dangerous behavior can be triggered via postMessage)

Required:

- When sending messages, MUST set an explicit `targetOrigin` (not `*`) to avoid
  sending data to an unexpected origin after redirects or window origin changes.
  ([MDN Web Docs][5])
- When receiving messages, MUST:

  - Validate `event.origin` exactly against an allowlist of expected origins (no
    substring matching). ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][6])
  - Consider validating `event.source` (expected window reference) when
    applicable. ([MDN Web Docs][5])
  - Validate `event.data` structure (schema/shape) and treat it purely as data
    (never evaluate it as code and never insert into DOM with `innerHTML`).
    ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][6])

Insecure patterns:

- `otherWindow.postMessage(payload, "*")`
- `window.addEventListener("message", (e) => { doSomething(e.data) })` with no
  `origin` check
- `if (e.origin.includes("trusted.com"))` (substring checks)
- `el.innerHTML = e.data` ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][6])

Detection hints:

- Search for `postMessage(`, `addEventListener("message"`, `onmessage =`.
- Audit all handlers for explicit allowlist checks on `event.origin`.
  ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][6])

Fix:

- Define an allowlist:

  - `const ALLOWED = new Set(["https://app.example.com", "https://accounts.example.com"]);`
    NOTE: For ease of development, you can use the current page's origin
    `window.location.origin` as a safe default origin.
- On receive:

  - `if (!ALLOWED.has(event.origin)) return;`
  - Validate `event.data` with a strict schema and reject unknown/extra fields.
- On send:

  - use the exact expected origin string as `targetOrigin`.
    ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][6])

Mitigation:

- Combine with a strict CSP and avoid DOM sinks in message paths.
  ([MDN Web Docs][10])

---

### JS-STORAGE-001: Web Storage is not a safe place for secrets (and is attacker-influencable)

Severity: Low

Required:

- MUST NOT store sensitive secrets or session identifiers in `localStorage` (or
  `sessionStorage`) if compromise would matter; a single XSS can exfiltrate
  everything in storage. ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][6])
- MUST treat values read from storage as untrusted input (attackers can load
  malicious values into storage via XSS). ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][6])
- SHOULD prefer server-set cookies with `HttpOnly` for session identifiers (JS
  cannot set `HttpOnly`, so avoid storing session IDs in JS-accessible storage).
  ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][6])
- SHOULD avoid hosting multiple unrelated apps on the same origin if they rely
  on storage separation (storage is origin-wide).
  ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][6])

Insecure patterns:

- `localStorage.setItem("access_token", token)`
- `localStorage.setItem("session", sessionId)`
- Assuming `localStorage` is “trusted because same-origin.”

Detection hints:

- Search for `localStorage.getItem`, `localStorage.setItem`, `sessionStorage.*`.
- Flag storage keys named `token`, `jwt`, `session`, `auth`, `refresh`.
  ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][6])

Fix:

- Use server-managed sessions or short-lived tokens delivered and rotated
  securely, with careful XSS defenses (CSP/Trusted Types) and minimal JS
  exposure.
- If storage must be used for non-sensitive state, keep it non-auth and
  validate/escape before use.

---

### JS-SUPPLY-001: Third-party JavaScript is a major supply-chain risk; minimize and control it

Severity: Low

Required:

- MUST treat third-party JS as equivalent to first-party JS in privilege (it can
  execute arbitrary code in your origin and access DOM data).
  ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][7])
- SHOULD minimize third-party scripts and prefer:

  - self-hosting / script mirroring,
  - strict CSP allowlists,
  - SRI for any CDN-hosted scripts,
  - ongoing monitoring for unexpected changes. ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][7])

Insecure patterns:

- Loading arbitrary remote scripts from many vendors without review.
- Using tag managers that can dynamically inject scripts with no integrity
  controls.
- Allowing scripts from broad wildcards in CSP (e.g., `script-src *`).
  ([MDN Web Docs][10])

Detection hints:

- Search HTML for `<script src="https://...">` and `tag manager` snippets.
- Search CSP `script-src` sources for wildcards or overly broad domains.
- Search for dynamic script injection: `document.createElement("script")`,
  `script.src = ...`, `appendChild(script)`. ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][8])

Fix:

- Remove unnecessary third-party tags.
- Self-host or mirror scripts where possible.
- Lock down CSP `script-src` to the smallest set of trusted sources.
- Add SRI for CDN scripts/styles. ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][7])

---

### JS-SRI-001: Use Subresource Integrity (SRI) for third-party scripts/styles

Severity: Low

Required:

- SHOULD use SRI to ensure browsers only load third-party resources if they
  match an expected cryptographic hash. ([MDN Web Docs][12])
- MUST update SRI hashes whenever the underlying resource changes (pin versions;
  avoid “latest” URLs).

Insecure patterns:

- `<script src="https://cdn.example.com/lib.js"></script>` with no `integrity`.
- Loading `latest` or unpinned third-party resources.

Detection hints:

- Search for `<script src="https://` and `<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://`
  without `integrity=`.
- Check whether `integrity` is present and uses strong hashes (sha256/384/512
  are typical). ([MDN Web Docs][12])

Fix:

- Add `integrity="sha384-..."` (or appropriate) and ensure proper CORS mode
  where needed.
- Prefer self-hosting critical libraries.

---

### FS-DOMC-001: Prevent DOM clobbering (avoid relying on `window`/`document` named properties)

Severity: Medium to High (can become Critical if it enables script loading or
`javascript:` navigation)

Required:

- MUST NOT rely on implicit global variables or `window.someName` /
  `document.someName` lookups that can be clobbered by injected HTML elements
  with matching `id`/`name`. ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][8])
- MUST avoid patterns like
  `let x = window.redirectTo || "/safe"; location.assign(x);` where `redirectTo`
  could be clobbered to an `<a>` element whose `href` is attacker-controlled
  (including `javascript:`). ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][8])
- SHOULD use explicit variable declarations, local scope, and explicit DOM
  queries (`getElementById`) rather than named property access.
  ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][8])
- If the app inserts user-controlled markup (even sanitized), SHOULD ensure
  sanitization strategies consider `id`/`name` collisions.
  ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][8])

Insecure patterns:

- `const cfg = window.config || {};` used for security-sensitive URLs.
- `const redirect = window.redirectTo || "/"; location.assign(redirect);`
  ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][8])
- Loading scripts from `window.*` config values without strict validation.

Detection hints:

- Search for `window.` and `document.` used as config stores (especially `||`
  fallback patterns).
- Search for usage of `location.assign/replace` with variables that come from
  `window`/`document` properties.
- Search for dynamic script creation (`createElement('script')`) where `.src`
  comes from a non-local variable. ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][8])

Fix:

- Store config in module-scoped constants (not on `window`/`document`) and pass
  it explicitly.
- Validate any URL-like config with protocol/origin allowlists (see
  FEJS-URL-001). ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][8])
- Consider hardening: sanitization, CSP, and (in limited cases) freezing
  sensitive objects, but treat these as defense-in-depth, not a substitute for
  safe coding patterns. ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][8])

## 5) Practical scanning heuristics (how to “hunt”)

When actively scanning, use these high-signal patterns:

- DOM XSS sinks:

  - `.innerHTML`, `.outerHTML`, `insertAdjacentHTML(`
  - `document.write(`, `document.writeln(` ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][2])

- Dangerous navigation / URL sinks:

  - `window.location`, `location.href`, `location.assign`, `location.replace`
  - `javascript:` literals (and other suspicious schemes like `data:text/html`)
    ([MDN Web Docs][4])

- String-to-code execution:

  - `eval(`, `new Function`, `setTimeout("`, `setInterval("`
    ([MDN Web Docs][10])

- Event-handler string injection:

  - `.setAttribute("on`, `.onclick =`, `.onload =` with strings
    ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][2])

- `postMessage`:

  - `postMessage(` with `"*"` as targetOrigin
  - `addEventListener("message"` without strict `event.origin` allowlist checks
    ([MDN Web Docs][5])

- Storage:

  - `localStorage.setItem(` / `getItem(`, `sessionStorage.*`
  - keys containing `token`, `jwt`, `session`, `auth`, `refresh`
    ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][6])

- CSP and related:

  - `Content-Security-Policy` header config (server/edge)
  - `<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" ...>`
  - CSP containing `unsafe-inline` or `unsafe-eval`
  - `require-trusted-types-for` / `trusted-types` directives ([MDN Web Docs][1])

- Third-party scripts:

  - `<script src="https://...">` without `integrity=`
  - Tag manager snippets and dynamic script injection code paths
    ([MDN Web Docs][12])

- DOM clobbering gadgets:

  - `window.<name> || ...` and `document.<name> || ...` patterns
  - security-sensitive usage of `window`/`document` properties as config sources
    ([OWASP Cheat Sheet Series][8])

Always try to confirm:

- data origin (untrusted vs trusted),
- sink type (HTML parse, navigation, code execution, message handling, storage),
- protective controls present (CSP, Trusted Types, sanitizers, strict
  allowlists, schema validation).
