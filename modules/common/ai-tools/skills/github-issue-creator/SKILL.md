# GitHub Issue Creator

Transform messy input (error logs, voice notes, screenshots) into clean,
actionable GitHub issues.

## Output Template

```markdown
## Summary

[One-line description of the issue]

## Environment

- **Product/Service**:
- **Region/Version**:
- **Browser/OS**: (if relevant)

## Reproduction Steps

1. [Step]
2. [Step]
3. [Step]

## Expected Behavior

[What should happen]

## Actual Behavior

[What actually happens]

## Error Details
```

[Error message/code if applicable]

```
## Visual Evidence
[Reference to attached screenshots/GIFs]

## Impact
[Severity: Critical/High/Medium/Low + brief explanation]

## Additional Context
[Any other relevant details]
```

## Output Location

**Create issues as markdown files** in `/issues/` directory at the repo root.
Use naming convention: `YYYY-MM-DD-short-description.md`

## Guidelines

**Be crisp**: No fluff. Every word should add value.

**Extract structure from chaos**: Voice dictation and raw notes often contain
the facts buried in casual language. Pull them out.

**Infer missing context**: If user mentions "same project" or "the dashboard",
use context from conversation or memory to fill in specifics.

**Placeholder sensitive data**: Use `[PROJECT_NAME]`, `[USER_ID]`, etc. for
anything that might be sensitive.

**Match severity to impact**:

- Critical: Service down, data loss, security issue
- High: Major feature broken, no workaround
- Medium: Feature impaired, workaround exists
- Low: Minor inconvenience, cosmetic

**Image/GIF handling**: Reference attachments inline. Format:
`![Description](attachment-name.png)`

## Examples

**Input (voice dictation)**:

> so I was trying to deploy the agent and it just failed silently no error
> nothing the workflow ran but then poof gone from the list had to refresh and
> try again three times

**Output**:

```markdown
## Summary

Agent deployment fails silently - no error displayed, agent disappears from list

## Environment

- **Product/Service**: Azure AI Foundry
- **Region/Version**: westus2

## Reproduction Steps

1. Navigate to agent deployment
2. Configure and deploy agent
3. Observe workflow completes
4. Check agent list

## Expected Behavior

Agent appears in list with deployment status, errors shown if deployment fails

## Actual Behavior

Agent disappears from list. No error message. Requires page refresh and retry.

## Impact

**High** - Blocks agent deployment workflow, no feedback on failure cause

## Additional Context

Required 3 retry attempts before successful deployment
```
