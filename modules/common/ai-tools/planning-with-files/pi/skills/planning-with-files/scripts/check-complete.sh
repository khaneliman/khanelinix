# Check if all phases in task_plan.md are complete
# Default invocation: advisory echo, always exits 0 (Stop hook status report).
# With --gate: deliberate completion gate, opt-in per plan via <plan-dir>/.mode.
# Used by Stop hook to report task completion status.
#
# Plan-file resolution (v2.40+):
#   1. $1 (explicit path) — first non-flag positional argument
#   2. resolve-plan-dir.sh: $PLAN_ID env → .planning/.active_plan → newest mtime
#   3. Legacy ./task_plan.md
#
# This restores slug-mode parity: the Stop hook and any caller invoking with
# zero args now respects the active plan dir instead of silently defaulting to
# the legacy root path.
#
# Gate mode (v3, --gate flag):
#   The gate is OFF unless ALL of these hold (design "Gate decision table"):
#     1. <plan-dir>/.mode exists and contains "gate" (explicit opt-in)
#     2. an in_progress phase exists (not merely complete<total)
#     3. the Stop hook input JSON on stdin does not set stop_hook_active=true
#     4. the block counter (<plan-dir>/.stop_blocks) is below cap (PWF_GATE_CAP, default 20)
#     5. the ledger advanced since the last block (stall → allow stop)
#   When all hold, it emits a single-line block-decision JSON on stdout and
#   exits 0. Otherwise it falls back to advisory output and exits 0.
#   Without --gate, or in non-gated mode, behavior is byte-equivalent to v2.43.
#
# Stdin handling: the Claude Code Stop hook pipes a JSON payload on stdin. To
# avoid hanging when nothing is piped, stdin is read ONLY when fd 0 is not a
# TTY ([ -t 0 ]). Hook-piped input is EOF-terminated, so the read returns; an
# interactive terminal (TTY) is skipped entirely. No data on stdin is treated
# as stop_hook_active=false.

# issue #195: per-invocation opt-out (PLANNING_DISABLED=1) for one-shot/CI
# sessions that share a cwd with a plan but never opted into it.
